Last August, I finally finished my report for the DFG regarding my wonderful two years at Michigan. Part of this was to revisit all my old notes and publications. This has reminded me of something I've been wanting to do for a long time -- publish every last bit of research I produced during my PhD and postdoc.

A big part of this would be an effort to digitalize my handwritten notebooks. But what is a good platform? I could blog them, page after page, transcribing them and annotating the images. But perhaps a MediaWiki is a more suitable alternative? After all, searching navigating blog posts isn't exactly easy. Or perhaps both (should just be copy&paste).

Perhaps I should use image annotations to directly markup the images? Perhaps I should wait for Hypothes.is to support this? Also, pushing things to figshare would allow people to reference every note with DOI etc -- that's great, no? But are there other tools? Better tools? I have no clue. Help would be appreciated.

Well, as you might have guessed, this draft has been sitting here for the last 6 months. So instead of waiting for the perfect solution, I'll start with the straight forward and reliable one. One blog post per page, transcribing the page, possibly adding translations, notes, comments. Since my notebooks sometimes contain personal notes, I will not necessarily publish every page of every notebook. For the same reason, I might blur parts of a page etc. Hopefully, this won't be too much of a mess (and interesting to someone, at least give them a laugh or something). We'll see how it goes.
