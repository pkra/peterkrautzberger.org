Well, with [mathblogging.org](http://www.mathblogging.org) up and running in beta I have been reading far too many math blogs (and I love it). This morning there was a lot of interesting stuff out there and I thought it might be interesting to mention some, especially those that I actually left a comment on. After all, that’s what makes blogging come alive and I don’t comment often enough.

## researchblogging vs arxivblogging

[Andrew Gelman (sorry for the error earlier) of Statistical Modelling](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/01/regression_disc.html "...") posted what is essentially a short review of a paper. I was too lazy to check if the paper had been published, but I left a comment anyway (although now, a couple of hours later I can’t see it and I can’t remember if comments are creened or if I screwed up; oh well, I’ll risk a double post tomorrow). The post reminded me of one the things I miss in the mathematical blogosphere — using [researchblogging.org](http://researchblogging.org) to spread word about reviews. I mean, go there and check the mathematics tag. It could really use more posts to give the almighty mathscinet neutrality machine some competition… (and yes, that includes myself and I already have an idea).

The question is if arXiv papers are “allowed” there since researchblogging is all about peer-reviewed papers. Of course, [there was a discussion on mathoverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/51056/is-there-a-place-where-people-discuss-arxiv-org-papers) on discussing arxiv papers and there actually seems to be [a project for that called scirate](http://scirate.com/) unfortunately with little traffic, the last development blog entry from 2008 and little moderation. Oh well.

## Pondering visitors

[Lieven Le Bruyn of neverendingbooks](http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/the-reddit-aftereffect.html) discusses his recent prominence on reddit/math which led him to review how his readers find him. It’s an interesting read and made me write a short post for myself answering his fundamental questions at the end for mysel (which I’ll post some other time).

## Writing experiments

[Peter Rowlett of Travels in mathematics](http://travelsinamathematicalworld.blogspot.com/2011/01/400-words-in-30-minutes-on-chaos-and.html) starts an experiment for writing more frequently. Great idea, he does a great job and makes me want to copy him. (but, boy, I had forgotten how complicated blogspot’s comment system is…)
