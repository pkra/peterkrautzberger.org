As one of the founders of mathblogging.org I know quite a few blogs (we aggregate over 600 and I've read them all at some point, crazy as that sounds -- and some _are_ crazy).

One of the things that fascinated me about science blogs back when I started reading blogs (before I tried to read math blogs) was the interaction between bloggers from all walks of scientific life -- graduate students, postdocs, tenure track, tenured, and industrial scientists, they all exchanged their thoughts and experiences encouragingly.

Mathematical blogs however lack this interaction. Of course, this has to do with the fact that "mathematics" is much smaller than, say, "life sciences", blogging is smaller still, so the chances of finding high quality bloggers is naturally lower. However, there's one striking difference. Very, very few "established researchers" bloggers take any interest in helping the next generation along (really, the only example I can come up with is the n-Category Cafe // n-Lab, but they seem mostly concerned with keeping their community going).

In my time in Michigan, I have annoyed almost every grad students I knew, trying to convince them that blogging is important. Not as a hipster thing, but as an academic tool that allows you to connect with your peers, experiment with your writing, help the community by exposition etc. I cannot blame the graduate students for being sceptical. They learn almost nothing about the future in academia during graduate school, their training does not include anything about becoming an active participant of the community (say, compared to US-jurisprudence where important journals are run by students) and generally they are discouraged from doing anything other than producing a new result that they can put in their thesis (So say we all!).

Another factor, in my experience, is the lack of pseudonymous research bloggers in mathematics. Again, the science blogosphere is much more open and supportive of this -- can you even imagine having a role model like Scicurious in mathematics? Of course, within the mathematical community the tolerance towards anonymous or even pseudonymous activity is rather low in general ([MathOverflow](http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/335/why-not-real-names/#Item_0) still suffers from this).

Anyway, what I really wanted to write about is the state of the AMS grad student blog. You probably never heard of it (or the other semi-regularly active blog, PhD+epsilon). The AMS does a good job at preventing you from finding the blogs on their website (which is still miserably focused on its business model -- books, journals and mathreviews).

When I first discovered the [AMS graduate student blog](http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/), I was impressed by its quality. What suprised me (actually, still does) is the weird state of it. From what I can gather, it wasn't founded by graduate students or through some community effort. Instead, it looks to me like Frank Morgan (AMS vice president) who [also blogs](http://sites.williams.edu/Morgan/) (more recently also [at HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-morgan/) of all anti-scientific places but at least in good company of ["Dr." (yeah, seriously) Keith Devlin](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-keith-devlin/)) supported the idea and helped host the blog (at least it's wordpress...). Obviously, the support from the AMS isn't enough to get the grad student blog on the actual AMS domain (let alone a correct subdomain). Then again, not even the postdoc blog [PhD+epsilon](http://www.ams.org/blog/phdplus/), or the other "seasonal" blogs.

Needless to say, none of the grad student bloggers does so anonymously.
