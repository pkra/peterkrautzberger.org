### Transcript

*   Notiz:
    *   wieso $\mathbb{Z} + p \subseteq \mathbb{N^*}$ fuer $\mathbb{N^*} \ni p$ (evtl. min. id.pot.)
    *   Kopie von $\mathbb{Z}$?
    *   [this note was struck out by a check mark]
*   Frage nicht standard PA-Modelle:
    *   gibt es Eigenschaften, die sich reflektieren lassen?
    *   Gibt es Reflektionsprinzip?
    *   [the above two lines were struck out with as single line]
    *   [illegible] Wenn es ein [struck out]
    *   Idee: Wenn ein Nicht standard element
    *   eine Eigenschaft hat
    *   so haben unendlich viele Numerale
    *   diese Eigenschsft, also
    *   unendlich viele Nicht-Standard
        *   [da elementare Substr]
    *   Richtig?
    *   Was kann man damit machen?

### partial Translation

*   Note:
    *   Why is $\mathbb{Z} + p \subseteq \mathbb{N^*}$ for any $\mathbb{N^*} \ni p$ (possibly just minimal idempotent)
    *   Copy of $\mathbb{Z}$?
    *   [this note was struck out by a check mark]
*   Question about non-standard models of PA
    *   are there properties that can be reflected?
    *   Are there reflection principles?
    *   [the above two lines were struck out with as single line]
    *   Idea: If a non-standard element has some property, then infinitely many numerals have this property and therefore infinitely many non-standard elements have this property (as an elementary substructure).
    *   Correct? What can you do with it?

### Notes

The previous page is followed by another attempt of research ideas.

First there's a note on a basic but important observation for $\beta \mathbb{N}$ -- it contains lots of copies of $\mathbb{Z}$. I remember trying to figure this out and ending up asking Sabine Koppelberg -- and the solution took two second, leaving me miserably disappointed by my failure.

To understand the second part of the note, I should explain that my Diplom thesis was about large cardinals and reflection principles. The first few things I tried that summer came out of that perspective -- looking at cardinals (as a semingroup with ordinal addition/multiplication), hoping to connect with large cardinal theory. Nothing ever came of it but perhaps we'll encounter that later in this workbook.
