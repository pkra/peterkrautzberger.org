In Immanuel Kant's essay [_Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beantwortung_der_Frage:_Was_ist_Aufkl%C3%A4rung%3F) ([Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_is_Enlightenment%3F)) he writes

> Aufklärung ist der Ausgang des Menschen aus seiner selbstverschuldeten Unmündigkeit.

The word "Unmündigkeit" is somewhat difficult to translate, it appears. English Wikipedia gives is as follows (please forgive the blatant gender imbalance):

> Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.

Immaturity, to me, seems a bad translation. Not that it isn't one meaning of Unmündigkeit and not that it isn't part of the wonderful image brought up by Kant's formulation. But for me, Unmündigkeit first and foremost stands for nonage, not being of age, being a minor -- self-inflicted, mind you (can you imagine?). Then there's also the notion of tutelage hiding in _Unmündigkeit_ and so much more.

(From my limited experience, ["Sapere aude!" (Dare to know!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapere_aude) is the better known quote here in the States. But it makes little sense without a reason why you should dare to know.)

I keep using this notion in many discussion at the moment. Two major arenas are _teh internetz_ and _academia_.

### Google vs the world

The Guardian is currently running a series [Battle for the internet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/battle-for-the-internet) and Sergey Brin wrote something for it.

German newspapers, in their far too usual Leistungsschutzrecht-google-bashing-kneejerk-reaction, criticized Brin since Google supposedly is "just as bad" as Apple and Facebook. Now I must admit that I'm somewhat addicted to Google's services. But I'm aware of that and I sincerely hope for the day that EU regulation (I'm not waiting for US regulation...) will force Google to offer its services as a paid, by privacy respecting services. But I can't help but think that Google is still significantly less evil than Apple and Facebook. I'm no expert, but a few things come to mind

*   support of open standards
*   support of open source (on so many levels)
*   good data export
*   Android as an open, hackable platform

Sure google+ seems to be yet another walled garden. But google is, above all, search. And that search can be used by anyone, no matter if they buy a device or sign up to a platform.

Now of course, google tracks searches heavily, invades user privacy since they are the product not the client.

But this is precisly the point where "selbstverschuldete Unmündigkeit" comes into the picture. The difference between Google and Facebook/Apple is that with Google you can still dare to know, in particular to know how to use it without compromising your privacy. Sure this requires more work (e.g. my standard setup is two use 2 browsers, with privacy ensuring tools, one running in incognito mode all the time but over the course of the day I'll frequently switch to a third and fourth brower for different tasks and added privacy -- and I'm not even talking about TOR and other hardcore methods).

Of course all of this is a lot of trouble. But that's what being of-age is like. So don't complain about your self-chosen nonage.

### Academia

I think the first time I used "selbstverschuldete Unmündigkeit" publicly was [in a discussion at Stephen Curry's blog](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/01/28/why-i-chose-to-decline-an-invitation-to-review-by-elsevier/#comment-8169). And this takes us right into the middle of the publishing debate.

It's been striking how many of my recent conversations, discussions and down-right fights have come back to the issue of "selbstverschuldete Unmündigkeit". The current publishing system is extremely "entmuendigend" --
