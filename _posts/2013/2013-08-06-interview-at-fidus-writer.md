In the everlasting "what I've said elsewhere" category, I haven't really written much about MathJax around here; MathJax as my job, that is. Perhaps I should do it more often.

Anyway, Fidus Writer is a very interesting open source project for academic, collaborative writing in the cloud, putting HTML first and providing $\LaTeX$ and epub3 output. They interviewed me (representing the MathJax team) and the result is now [on their blog](http://fiduswriter.com/2013/08/06/math-in-the-browser/).
