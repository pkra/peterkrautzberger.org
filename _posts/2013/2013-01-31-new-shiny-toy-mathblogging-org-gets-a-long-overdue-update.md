It's been a lot of work and it has been delayed again and again, but here it is: [mathblogging.org 2.0](http://www.mathblogging.org), powered by SubjectSeeker, the software behind [ScienceSeeker](http://scienceseeker.org).

Read [the announcement](http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/welcome-to-the-new-mathblogging-org/).

I would like to thank Dave Munger and the team at ScienceSeeker -- especially Gabriel and his infinite patience and support.

I would like to thank Sam for his support, expertise and everything.

Run, you fools! Go and break the server!
