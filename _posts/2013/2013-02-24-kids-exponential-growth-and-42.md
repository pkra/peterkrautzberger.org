Last week, I was lucky enough to attend the [W3C workshop on ebooks](http://www.w3.org/2012/08/electronic-books/) in NYC. This allowed me to visit some old and very dear friends. In a conversation with one of their kids, I pulled out a classic that I like very much.

Today, I did some fact checking and -- lo and behold -- the answer was not 52 but [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number))! That is, of course, [fantastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_The_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29).

Anyway, the question I asked was: how thick is an piece of regular office paper if you fold it <del>52</del> 42 times?

The answer is: it would reach all the way to the moon!

That usually surprises kids (and non-kids) and is a nice example for the surprises of [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth#Exponential_stories). In fact, it also surprises me and I'm always somewhat nervous when a kid takes me up on the offer of checking that the number is actually correct.

For this you first have to decide what paper you're looking at. A piece of [A4 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series) (I'm German after all) is on average 0.1 mm. That's actually hard to estimate but it's what I eventually found [on the interwebs](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JuliaSherlis.shtml); if you have the time, I invite you to delve into the art of [density and calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_density#Caliper).

When you fold it 42 times, it's as if you stacked <span>test</span> $2^{42}$ pieces of paper on top of each other. So the thickness is $2^{42}$ x 0.1mm, which is ~439,804 km (and a kilometer is 1,000,000 milimeter).

The [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) is on average 384,400km from earth, and 405,410km at its farthest -- so we'll get there no matter what day. If, that is, we could fold a piece of paper 42 times.

For what it's worth, the world record for folding paper is 13 times -- achieved by [high schoolers on MIT's campus](http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2011/12/toilet_paper_used_to_break_pap.html) in 2011.
