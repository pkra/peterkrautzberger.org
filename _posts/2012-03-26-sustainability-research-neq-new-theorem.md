While visiting Toronto in late March, I had the pleasure of meeting fellow Booles' Rings peepz Mike and Assaf (and of course Sam and Kathleen who graciously hosted me).

In our short coffee break, Assaf asked me about an [old comment of mine](http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/2012/01/29/a-comment-on-tim-gowerss-blog/#comment-451968126):

> [...] mathoverflow has probably created more impact than an entire year of Inventiones papers.

I essentially chickened out of an argument with Assaf about this and I don't want to try to badly recollect this. So let me write about something that came to mind afterwards.

### Why could I even think this?

The usual criticism I encounter when I argue for less papers and less "new theorems" is that

> research = new theorem

In particular, if I argue that we need to value more research activity than that, I often encounter bafflement of the form "but nothing else IS research".

It's hard to argue against this opinion because nobody doubts that new theorems _are_ research. When I argue that we need to find a way to write less papers than, in effect, I am advocating to prove fewer theorems. So it seems as if I'm arguing against progress in mathematics.

Respectfuly, I disagree.
