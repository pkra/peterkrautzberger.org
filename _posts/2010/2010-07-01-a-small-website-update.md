You probably wouldnâ€™t have noticed, but I worked on the website a little. The only visible change is that I have added some more permanent content. You can find [the about page](.) page as well as a page called [resources, links and friends](.) in the top right column.

(**Note from 2015:** I retired those pages at some point and cannot reconstruct the respective content.)
