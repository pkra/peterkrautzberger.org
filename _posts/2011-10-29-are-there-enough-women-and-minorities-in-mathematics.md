So, once again, I couldn't help myself and complain over at Peter Cameron's Blog about his view on the topic of women (and let me extend this topic to minorities) in mathematics.

Don't get me wrong, I believe that Peter Cameron thinks gender has nothing to do with mathematical ability; I also believe he acts accordingly, not judging his students regarding their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity etc. (All this even thouhg I have only communicated with Peter Cameron via the internet -- yay intertubes!)

Since I ranted a little over at his blog again let me follow up here for a change. In one of his comments, http://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/when-i-walk-into-the-room/#comment-3144 Peter writes

> My first feedback on this post was something along the lines of “Why do we need more women in mathematics?” In view of my attitude, I hear this as “Why do we need more mathematicians?”

This is just silly to me. If you believe that women are just as talented as men in mathematics, then having more women in mathematics makes a lot of sense.

Simply put: if women and men are equally talented and both sides have similar obstacles in becoming mathematicians, then wouldn't you expect to see a percentage of women in mathematics that is near the percentage in the general population?

And reversely, if we don't have the same percentage in mathematics as we have in the general population, doesn't this mean that there are people out there (e.g., the most talented female non-mathematicians) that would be MORE talented than a large part of the men in mathematics?

This is precisely what I have experienced myself over and over again: talented women in my academic cohort have left mathematics or academia even though (imho) they were much more talented than a lot of the male mathematicians I've met.

If we really strive to lead the greatest mathematical talents to become mathematicians, then we should focus on identifying those highly talented individuals. As a consequence, if you believe that women and men are equally talented, the number of female mathematicians is indeed a very useful benchmark for this.

So what about Peter Cameron's call for "more mathematicians"? I think it's misdirected to ask for more mathematicians if our means of finding the most talented female mathematicians have obviously failed in the last few decades. What we need to do is find out what's going wrong -- and we don't have to, there are plenty of studies.

But we cannot dismiss this benchmark. As a field, we'll suffer much more if we do not solve this problem of our research community.
