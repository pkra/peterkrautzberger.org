There is a lot of catching up to do… Let’s get started.

As I mentioned Tim Gowers’s use of Prezi <del>[the other day](http://peter.krautzberger.info/2010/05/math_newspapers)</del> a while ago, I found [this incredible example of prezi](http://prezi.com/aww2hjfyil0u/math-is-not-linear/) <del>today</del> shortly thereafter but never got around posting it. In the mean time I stumbled upon more things worth (re)posting all over the intertubes.

As always, I’m amazed when somebody can explain probability to me — this time over at [cosmic variance on normalizability](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/05/17/non-normalizable-probability-measures-for-fun-and-profit/). Also,, I cannot not mention [this years best optical illusion](http://www.scienceblogs.de/mathlog/2010/05/illusion-des-jahres-3.php "via Thilo Kuessner's mathlog").

Slightly related, there has been an [amazing experiment at the University of Texas, Austin, mentioned on 80beats](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/05/21/refuting-einstein-in-4-easy-steps-physicists-measure-brownian-motion/). Fortunately, just because real Brownian Motion becomes predictable the mathematical notion remains the same — but I wonder if this will lead to confusion in the far future…

Last but not least, [bioephemera lead me to Dan Meyer’s <span class="caps">TED</span> talk](http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2010/05/fixing_our_impatience_with_irr.php), which is cool and insightful.

The slightly worrying thing is that the best place to find good mathematics blogging (at least the science journalism kind) is on non-mathematical blogs…
