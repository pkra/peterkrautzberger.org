Oh well. What can I say. New site, yadayada. It had to happen some time.

Switching back to a static site generator. Jekyll, which took me a while to decide on. In the end, [Ian Mulvany](http://partiallyattended.com/2015/02/04/the-70-90-rule/) rang true. Jekyll is trivial to set up (I'm using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)/[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/)), hosting on GitHub pages, some simple CI via Travis).

I thought about exploring other static-site generators (in particular JS-based ones) but, in the end, Jekyll is *the* static-site generator so it's easy to switch to and from if I need to.

I'm not yet going to switch the old site over since I have yet to properly import the older content, set up redirects etc.
