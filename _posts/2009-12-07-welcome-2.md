After more and more intense blog reading over the last couple of months  
 it felt right to try to start my own blog for the <strike>first</strike> second time.

For the moment everything in this blog will be experimental which seems  
 appropriate given that I am not PhD student any more but have not  
 officially started my PostDoc yet.

The main purpose of this blog (in the long run) will be to document my  
 own research activities (in the broadest of senses, although usually  
 just mathematics). Of course, due to the nature of the web this blog is  
 bound to include random bits of other things, hopefully including  
 experimental use of the web as a medium, in particular for presenting  
 mathematics.

Enjoy, Peter.
