When I started watching the videos from last years Books in Browsers, my firs thought was: so that's where are the people are hiding that I want to talk to!

Going through them whenever I had the time and patience over the past few months, I was just floored by all the great ideas in the videos. And amazed that almost none of them are being applied to mathematical and scientific content yet.
