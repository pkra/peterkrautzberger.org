I frequently wind up with a list of interesting blog posts — so why not include this here, too? As long as I cannot convince myself to use google reader or buzz, I’ll do this the classical way (especially since I just read a complaint that less and less blogers use backlinks).

An old but very nice post on Graeme Taylor’s Modulo Errors — with beautiful linkage. I just spent 10 minutes cheering the algorithm for vehicles to succeed…

Gil Kallai continues his series of posts on the concept of probability  with a wonderful video by Itamar Pitowski

For the German speaking people — via [Christian Reinboth](http://www.scienceblogs.de/frischer-wind/2010/02/schones-video-faszination-der-mathematik.php) a nice (I’m guessing Austrian science department) video promoting mathematics.
