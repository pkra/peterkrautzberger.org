For a while now, I have wanted to spew out some of my thoughts on this whole publishing debate, ever since Tim Gowers started it last November (yes, November! unbelievable).

For the longest time has it bugged me that I think the entire debate is off-topic. I hope you, dear reader, could help me, please give me some feedback on these thoughts.

### What's wrong with journals?

From what I can hear from other people, there are two major issues. One, the prices for journals are too high. Two, the broken reviews process.

Of course, prima facie, the pricing is the biggest problem. It endangers the fairness within our community, that all researchers have a chance to read the best and brightest new results coming out. I would like, however, to argue that this is not the problem anymore.

==============  
 I think one point that both publishers as well as funders and researchers are ignoring is problem of paper inflation. We've become extraordinarily good at teaching people how to generate new research results. Because we evaluate researchers exclusively by papers, more and more papers are being produced, causing a flood of papers nobody is able read. Journals can't handle the amount (instead prasing rejection rates and backlogs), referees can't handle the result (since refereeing isn't considered "research activity", merely service) and readers can't handle the result, because there's just too damn much of it. So, very much, readers have become irrelevant because we do not publish to be read, we publish to publish, i.e, put it on our CV.

What's worse, we find ourselves in the situation where we can't find useful research related to ours --- not because nobody is doing it, but because it's impossible to notice it!

I second +Daniel Lemire that we need to seriously change our culture. But I think the change must be towards an attention economy (instead of the current "production" economy). That is, we must value (as research!) multiple efforts outside of "producing papers", in particular helping each other to find useful papers for our respective work (e.g., through post-publication peer-review).

In the end, I think, we must find a way to fight this inflation, to publish less and reduce the pressure, so that papers are published for "making public" instead of adding to impact factor collections.
