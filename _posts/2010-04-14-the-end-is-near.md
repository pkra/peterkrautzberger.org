Well, as promised, the end is near.

I have begun moving thelazyscience. The future location will be at [peter.krautzberger.info](http://peter.krautzberger.info/). It’ll probably take me a few more days to (manually…) move the old posts over to the new site. However, the next post is almost finished. I still have to see if I can find a mechanism to automagically put a short post up here for each new one there, but we’ll see.

It was good to have started the blog at blogspot but hopefully the new workflow (and more time) will lead to more frequent posts.
