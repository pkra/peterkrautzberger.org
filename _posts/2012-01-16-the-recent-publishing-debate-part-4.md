### leftovers from Nisan post // part 2

I cannot remember the last paper that I've read that I thought was a good paper. Take three aspects

*   the quality of writing in general
*   the clarity of proofs
*   the clarity regarding the importance of the result.

The first property is certainly the most difficult one. I believe that good writing can be learned, can be taught, but I think we lack a culture of writing in mathematics.

The second property is really annoying. Have you ever read a three page of a proof only to have the author tell you after the first page that this was all the base of an induction? The funniest thing is that this is actually solvable: computer checkable proofs. I dream of papers that consist of two parts: one prose, one computer checkable. Doron Zeilberger is fond of this, I think.

Personally, I have ended up writing my proofs as nested lists. I find it to be a useful strategy to reveal the structure of the proof to both reader and author; it allows expert readers to quickly browse through proofs while giving details to the non-expert. Finally, it keeps myself in check: if a bullet point becomes too long, I know I'm cheating, forcing me to decide whether to add a sub-level or honestly cheat with a "clearly" or a reference.

The third property is the most annoying one. Too many times have I read through a paper and finally realized that the result is actually not as involved as it sounds. I've seen authors make everyday results sound like the solution of the Riemann Hypothesis, but mostly I've read papers where people try to hide the fact that they've taken a result from somebody else and applied it to a nice problem (or maybe just tweaked it). I've done that, I think it's solid mathematics. But can we please be honest about this?

Of course, we cannot. And the reason brings this little side rant back to Nisan's posts. Since journals only accept "new" results and "important" ones at that, an average researcher has to pretend that their results are somewhat more than they seem. Those that can do this better, get better publications. That is, the system is being gamed.

As Nisan points out, there's pressure to publish as many papers as you can. That is, not the journal system is broken, but the function we, the mathematical research community, has assigned to it: to evaluate researchers. Because it is the only tool, we have a monoculture. And it leads to a mass of poorly written papers, "get it by the referee"-kind of papers.

I think if we want to get rid of the negative aspects of the publishing system, we must find a way to reduce this very pressure. Prevent the pressure of publishing as many "new" results as possible.

There are two ways, obviously: accept non-"new" results as valuable contributions to mathematics, i.e., as publishable in an acceptable journal, as acceptable in job applications and tenure evaluations.

Or publish less! Personally, I think we need both.

As much as I want a "surveys of contemporary mathematics" journal, I think we really need to leave our monoculture of journal papers. In the continuation of this series, I will certainly discuss the many objections that sound like "but MO-reputation points can be gamed".

Besides the fact that most of these objections are simply wrong (focusing on the reputation points and forgetting that there is content to be evaluated, data to be analyzed that easily goes beyond this), there's also a much more general argument to be made: as long as we allow a monoculture, we will always have a system that can be gamed. The journal system is being gamed!

Whereas if we have multiple systems, the effort to game all systems at once seems a much higher obstacle. Simply put, if a researcher has lots of MO-reputation, but not a single publication, what do you think of that researcher?

============================

## Plan:

*   A lot of people feel that something is wrong
*   Gowers, Nisan on "non-research"

*   Gowers, Nisan on the web of trust

*   CSProf publish other people's work
*   Accidental Mathematician: watch out for minorities
*   Nuit Blanche: headhunting publications

*   The problem is not the publishers, it's the community

*   We value only journal papers,
*   we value only "new" results
*   we rely on an oligarchy of editorial boards
*   Interestingly, enough, Gowers's second proposal is a service that used to be done by the peer-review system. So now we give the journals the same power with doing even less work -- awesomesauce, I'm sure Elsevier is happy.

## Try again

## short thoughts

We could be at the front, because our research could be done exclusively online (unlike sciences).

We won't be front-runners, because the pressure is much higher in the sciences battling bogus science (nobody really cares about math cranks -- and nobody worries about them either -- strawman)

The Salon-of-Paris-problem

the worker's rights of 19th century factories

the "gaming-the-system" problem. MO isn't fair because of e.g. Joel/Andreas for logic.  
 We need many systems to undermine the gaming. Right now, we have only one, the journal system. It can be gamed. It is being gamed -- oligarchy.

It's like "newspapers: if anybody can write, dear god, the king would have to listen?"

STuck inthe 19th century: free press, oligarchy, workers' rights.

Any system must not have points! MO points are stupid, activity is not! Datavis example shows: if there's content, we can identify meaning!!

an era of constant experimentation is upon us -- MO is the beginning, not the end! Just like facebook or resaerchgate or f1000

The oligarchic system is lazy: just like Kant, we need to leave selbstgewaehlte unmuendigkeit.
