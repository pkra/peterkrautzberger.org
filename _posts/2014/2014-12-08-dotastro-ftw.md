[This is week 4 of the challenge. woohoo.]

Today I only have ~15 min. This week, I happen to be in Chicago for [dotAstronomy 6](http://dotAstronomy.com/six). This might be odd since I'm not an astronomer (nowhere near in fact). It is actually an immense privilege, though, since I'm part of a small group of invited interdisciplinary participants (also including biologists, climate scientists and library scientists). So my perspective is that of an outsider and I hate to admit it: it's what I suspected all along.

That is, ever since running into the dotAstronomy website a few years ago, I have been a little envious. I kept thinking "This sounds incredibly fantastic. How could we do something like this for mathematics?" Until today I could at least pretend that it couldn't actually be as great as it appears. Because nothing is, right?

My two readers won't be surprised to hear it: I was wrong. dotAstro is every bit as exciting, enlightening, creative, and savvy as I had hoped. A fantastic group of scientists from all walks of scientific life, including "recovering" researchers who have been led to non-standard careers while retaining a deep, nay fierce enthusiasm for their field as well as for the untapped potential offered to scientific communities by the web. This first day has been a perfect mix, starting with excellent talks, switching to amazing lightning talks, followed by an exhausting-because-engaging unconference sessions, and finally some great conversation at the pub (including perfectly greasy US bar food).

Luckily, I don't have to bore you with my notes but can simply point you to the [live-blogging of the first day](http://dotastronomy.com/blog/2014/12/astro-6-live-blog-day-1/) by [@vrooje](https://twitter.com/vrooje). In case my notes go up in flames, I could probably reconstruct half of it from the Twitter hashtags of the unconference sessions I attended, i.e.,

*   [#hackj](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackj?src=hash) (hack the journal)
*   [#astrocult](https://twitter.com/hashtag/astrocult?src=hash) (identifying dotastro culture)
*   [#dotmu](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotmuse?src=hash) (make science museums better)
*   [#dotall](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dotall?src=hash) (reach out to all audiences)

Now I'm exhausted but excited for tomorrow's hack day.
