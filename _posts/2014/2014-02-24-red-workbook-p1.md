### Notes

This is the opening page of my first workbook, just after I had started to work on my PhD seriously (having finished my Diplom in Munich a few months earlier).

I'm using `p1` in the title to be intentionally vague -- while this happens to be page 1, I don't intend to publish every page, so the `p` might be read as `page`, `part`, or `piece`.

This workbook starts with a journal entry regarding traveling to TOPOSYM 2006 and continues with notes on the talks at TOPOSYM. It is curious to read those personal notes. For example, my first meeting with Wistar Comfort with whom I happened to share a close personal friend is notable mostly for the embarrassment I felt while being introduced to lots of researchers (whom WW Comfort all knew) whose name I barely caught (and never remembered) and with whom I wasn't able to have a conversation.

I won't reproduce the notes on conference talks -- they are neither interesting nor complete (and they deteriorate over the course of the week). I don't remember any of the talks now, but I remember the "performance" of some of the speakers (mostly the distinguished ones, like WW Comfort sharing stories from TOPOSYM during the Cold War). I do fondly remember spending that week with my fellow PhD students, Gido Scharfenberger and Steffi Frick, and getting the first taste of being among researchers -- exhilarating.
