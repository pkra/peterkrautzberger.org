Just a quick post to show I'm still alive. One of the reasons why I haven't gotten to write recently is that we moved (yet again) to the final-for-oh-I-don't-know-who-knows-hopefully-a-few-or-more-years-that-would-be-nice-for-a-change destination.

And it seems my new neighborhood is trying to tell me something.

Oh well. I supposes that's what you get for moving to the town where these folks spent very productive years.
