After more and more intense blog reading over the last couple of months it felt right to try to start my own blog for the <del>first</del> second time.

For the moment everything in this blog will be experimental which seems appropriate given that I am not PhD student any more but have not officially started my PostDoc yet.

The main purpose of this blog (in the long run) will be to document my own research activities (in the broadest of senses, although usually just mathematics). Of course, due to the nature of the web this blog is bound to include random bits of other things, hopefully including experimental use of the web as a medium, in particular for presenting mathematics.

Enjoy, Peter.
