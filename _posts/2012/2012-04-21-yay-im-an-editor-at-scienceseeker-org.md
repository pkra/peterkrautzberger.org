Apparently, I totally forgot to announce this anywhere on my interwebz!

With its [major code update](https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091827/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-new-features-and-new-editors/) three weeks ago, [scienceseeker.org](http://scienceseeker.org) introduced an editorial system where editors can mark particular posts and leave a small note -- and I was invited to become one of the fancy new editors (and given [my fellow editors](https://web.archive.org/web/20121029181018/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-our-new-slate-of-editors/) methinks I'm the n00b).

sciencseeker.org came out of [scienceblogging.org](http://scienceblogging.org) (originally dubbed its "v2.0"). (For those who remember, [Felix](http://www.fbreuer.de), [Fred](http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/wst/users/heymann/) and I [originally](http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/about/) modeled [mathblogging.org](http://mathblogging.org) after scienceblogging.org.)

In fact, scienceseeker.org is much more like mathblogging.org in that it accepts every blog with (some) scientific content. So it was only natural to meet up with [Dave Munger](http://twitter.com/#!/davemunger) at [Science Online 2012](http://scienceonline2012.com) (which was another one of those great [#Scio12](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23scio12) conversations that just keep returning like a million boomerangs).

Now if you visited [sciencseeker.org](http://scienceseeker.org) a few weeks ago, you may have found its database to be somewhat lacking in mathematical blogs. To remedy that, the kind people at scienceseeker.org accepted a list of ~30 of my favorite blogs I simply exported out of mathblogging.org (did you know you can [download our database as csv and opml](https://web.archive.org/web/20120307135703/http://www.mathblogging.org/feeds)?).

So I hope I'll be doing a decent job (and you probably won't be surprised if my picks for scienceseeker.org might also appear on [our Mathblogging.org Weekly Picks](http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/category/weekly-picks/). You can follow the [Editors' Picks on scienceseeker.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://scienceseeker.org/displayfeed/?type=post&filter0=modifier&value0=editorsPicks) and on twitter [@sciseekeds](http://twitter.com/#!/SciSeekEds). I usually post a pick every other day and on Fridays.
