For quite some time it has bugged me to hear male mathematicians make statements along the lines of

> I think we should only judge mathematicians on their academic achievements and so I'm against any kind of quota or extra support for female mathematicians.

I used to go on a rant about structural disadvantages for women in mathematics, in particular systematic discouragement in school and gender-biased teaching methods. (Oh, and don't get me started on those "well, women are just smarter and don't go into this nightmare of a field" argument.)

Nowadays, I usually respond by asking if they think there's a fundamental, maybe biological difference between women and men when it comes to their mathematical potential. So far I've always heard

> No, I believe talent for mathematics is to be found equally in men and women.

So.

Let me ask you.

If we have a 70-30 ratio (or whatever). Does that not mean that, on average, we should be able to replace 20% male mathematicians by female mathematicians that are **more** talented?

And wouldn't that be much "better" for mathematics?

So why are you against spending extra effort on identifying (and therefore helping) the talented female mathematicians?
