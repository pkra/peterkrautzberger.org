A few weeks ago, I carelessly wrote [here](http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/2013/07/17/name-5-top-journals-you-read/) that

> MathSciNet was the perfect search tool (although it feels like Google Scholar could ruin them if they wanted)

Asaf Karagila called BS on this:

> I don’t think Google Scholar, which is a great service can easily win over MathSciNet. The latter has the advantage of many mathematicians summarizing and reviewing papers. That’s something that is hard to replicate.

And of course, Asaf is right -- MathSciNet is not just about search. Math Reviews is the definite platform for reviews. It's also much more, it has a ton of convenience functionality, such as exposing references, getting you to your university's libraries to get a copy of the paper etc.

But is that enough?

The idea of [disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation) is all about the fact that the current market leader is not doing anything wrong or that some other competitor gets better. It's all about the fact that a worse competitor gets _good enough_ to disrupt the market. To quote Christensen (via Wikipedia)

> "Generally, disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches. They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream."[9]

Let me stress: **they offered less of what customers [...] wanted**. And yet, eventually, they disrupt the traditional market (by attracting the users that wanted more.

### Limits of Math Reviews.

*   I've seen criticisms that reviews are too often not helpful, little more than copy&paste-ing of abstracts (I haven't see that a lot, but given that you actually get AMS credit, there's incentive to do many reviews).

*   Math Reviews allows only one review.

*   Reviews are too limited. On the one hand, technical issues (dare I say: mistakes) are not often discussed (the mathematicians' old "anyone worth their salt as a mathematician can fix this" which brings us such small numbers of retractions despite no sign that math publications are any less flawed than regular science). On the other, non-mathematical issues (poor writing, bad structuring, best practices) seem off-topic as well.

### Better than MathSciNet's X

Now my original quote was only about search. And I think MathSciNet will continue to be the best package. But what if individual components are replaced?

If you look at search, Google scholar already adds some disruptive features, most prominently the "suggested papers". [Could this be enough](http://projectwordsworth.com/the-paradox-of-the-proof/)?

If you look for reviews, how quickly could the selected papers network or [pubpeer](http://pubpeer.com/publications/F0CFE0360002C25DC0BEFE28987D70) could be a better solution.

The problem is: MathSciNet is a cash cow for the American Mathematical Society. If this breaks away, the effects could be shocking.

### MathSciNet FTW

I do think, MathSciNet can easily survive these disruptions should they ever occur. MathSciNet has yet to explore the author pages. What could they become? A personal academic homepage? A career-center? A social network? The thing is: academia trusts academic societies because they control them through democratic oversight. That's a huge thing! The AMS could go much further with data analysis than anyone would let Google go (well, if they had a choice), simply because there is oversight and control to make sure data is not abused.
