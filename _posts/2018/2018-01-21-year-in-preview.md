I miss writing here; alot. I technically wrote twice as much here in 2017 than in 2016 (and up to No. 200) but it was still less than once a month; it became hard at some point. I used to be able to blame my work [for MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) because I was (at times) writing a lot for the project; I don't have that particular excuse [anymore](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathjax-dev/k48Q0NxiNoU/BRYlaDuaCAAJ).

I've never been one for looking back at the end of a year. But since the last year was complex (and this one is set up to be equally so) I thought maybe I should motivate myself by looking ahead to the things I want to write about this year (including things in my actual schedule for 2018).

* wrap up the series "The Problem with MathML as a web standard", my 10,000ft view of MathML's flaws.
  * this has taken far too much time already and I've started to hate coming back to it because of all the negativity around MathML (both the spec and the community).
* think about my upcoming workshop on equation rendering in ebooks at [Ebookcraft in March](http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/speakers/) (you should totally [register](http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/register/)!)
* think about the workshop I'm co-organizing at AIM on [web accessibility of mathematics in May](https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/webmath/)
* reminisce about my time at MathJax which shaped the past 5 years of my life
  * in particular, write about MathJax v3 a bit
* write about the future of equation rendering on the web as I think it could unfold
  * maybe wonder a bit about the future of real STEM content
* write up some thoughts and experiments from last year on how the web can (should and probably will) replace LaTeX for most people
* write down some observations from a workshop on authoring accessible STEM content for the web which I did together with [Bj√∂rn Fisseler](https://twitter.com/bfisseler) at FernUni Hagen last year.
* status updates for [mathblogging.org](https://mathblogging.org) and [boolesrings.org](https://boolesrings.org)
* write about [AMS MathViewer](http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/journalsframework/AMSMathViewer)

Ok, maybe stop here; it's a lot already.
