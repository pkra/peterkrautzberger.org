I wrote a few things in the last few months that I'd like to cross post (and I'll eventually archive them here).

First off, there's [Equations ≠ Math (Or: Equation layout as a print artifact)](https://www.booknetcanada.ca/blog/2018/1/12/equations-math-or-equation-layout-as-a-print-artifact) ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.booknetcanada.ca/blog/2018/1/12/equations-math-or-equation-layout-as-a-print-artifact)). This somewhat of a continuation (and hopefully a refinement) on [#196](/0196/).
