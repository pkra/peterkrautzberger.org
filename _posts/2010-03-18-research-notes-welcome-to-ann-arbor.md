After too many weeks of silence and almost two weeks in the States it is definitely time for an update.  
 The first 10 days at the [University of Michigan](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/) were taken up mostly by bureaucracy but some old and some new ideas have evolved out of my first two meetings with [Andreas Blass](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/).

On the one hand he has renewed his interest in the forcing construction of a non-Ramsey ultrafilter that [Claude Laflamme](http://math.ucalgary.ca/profiles/claude-laflamme) did under his supervision back in the 80s. In fact (spoiler alert) Andreas will talk about such things at the [<span class="caps">ASL</span> Meeting in Washington](http://www.aslonline.org/Meetings.htm) this week.

On my related part I have resumed work on constructing an unstable union ultrafilter which Andreas and I once had hoped to relate to the Laflamme forcings but later turned out not to. Mostly I spent time recovering my old strategies and had lots of them shot down by Andreas. Nevertheless I see progress there and look forward to spending more time on the issue (and hopefully blog about it, too).

Blog related the great change is finally coming up. I will switch to [blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com/), a blog compiler for static blogging, after I find a good place to host the new blog. I plan to switch to [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) for better MathML support and use [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments. This will simplify my publishing process and I hope it will lead to more frequent posts. After all I have not done enough writing so that it comes naturally to me.
