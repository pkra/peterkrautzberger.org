Early this morning, I drove down to San Diego to be at the [Joint Math Meetings 2013](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) for the very first time. (Well, last year, I mostly sneaked in to meet friends and didn't even register -- or got to talks, so I guess that's fair).

It seems ironic and yet fitting that my first JMM is also the first meeting since I left mathematical research (in the traditional and definitely the (for me) previous sense). Representing MathJax is challenging, exciting, and simply a lot of fun.

Of course, meeting up with old friends is an added bonus that's simply priceless.
