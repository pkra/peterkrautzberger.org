Welcome to the new home of thelazyscience. I hope the new setup makes everything better.

For myself, writing and posting has been simplified considerably by the use of [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) with [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile/index.php) as markup. The mathematics is simply [$\LaTeX$](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) code which gets ignored by textile and converted by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) . In fact, textile markup is so [human-readable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_medium) that I can see myself eventually writing exclusely in textile. Instead of explaining how this workflow works I invite you to read [Felix Breuer’s explanation](http://blog.felixbreuer.net/2010/03/19/writing-math.html) .

Additionally, the only dynamic part left is now organized by [Disqus](http://disqus.com) . Their tool makes commenting easy and hopefully reduces spam even further.

So, I hope you’ll enjoy the new lazy science. If you do, let me know.
