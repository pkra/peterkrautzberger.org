So now I need to rant a little. And it will sound as if I rant about Tim Gowers.

I have honestly nothing but admiration for Tim Gowers. But I'm annoyed with the way some people think everything he touches turns gold.

So I need to rant a little.

### Tim Gowers is awesome.

I'm certainly not qualified to praise his mathematics (and it is surely the least point of debate). I've read some of it and found it excellent. I've read some of his exposition and found it inspiring. I've seen him talk and, well, see for yourself -- for [the general public](http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/multiplying-and-dividing-whole-numbers-why-it-is-more-difficult-than-you-might), for [the mathematical public](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIJN4YMZZo) and [a graduate course on computational complexity](http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/545358).

Tim Gowers is also by far the best researcher blogger in mathematics. If you asked me for a single blog (of a researcher) that you should follow, then I would tell you to read Tim Gowers's.

(For a change, this is a statement I'm an expert in since I read a lot of (read: too many) blog posts coming through [mathblogging.org](http://www.mathblogging.org). So trust me when I say, he is the most well-rounded researcher blogger out there! (Yes, Terry-Tao-fans, he is.))

At [Science Online 2012](http://www.scienceonline.com), everyone who read Michael Nielsen's book "Reinventing Discovery" would say, Tim Gowers is "that massive collaboration guy", the person who started the [Polymath project](http://polymathprojects.org/). That's also pretty damn fantastic.

### What Tim Gowers isn't

[A blog post](http://nghoussoub.com/2012/01/26/timothy-gowers-a-leader-for-our-times/) by another great researcher blogger, Nassif Ghoussoub, triggered this little rant. A leader for our times -- makes me shudder. (By the way, Nassif Ghoussoub is definitely another blogger you should read!)

I'm annoyed with the fact that people automatically consider Tim Gowers to be a leader of our community. Without a doubt he is scientifically speaking. He is also in many other ways.

But where he is no a leader is when it comes to building the mathematical community of the future, that is, the mathematical community online.

And that's perfectly fine.

I don't think he intends to and I most certainly don't think he has an obligation.

What his work online is great in many ways. He also contributes greatly to the online community. But he's not building the community.

### Consider his blog.

It's a wonderful blog. But it's not building a community. He's not [the blogfather of mathematical blogging](http://scienceboxen.blogspot.com/2011/11/blogfather-interview-with-bora-zivkovic.html). In fact, there isn't (and cannot be) a mathematical equal to Bora. He rarely speaks about other bloggers, he rarely speaks about anybody else's work, he does not encourage blogging, he has no guest posts, he does not interact with a lot of bloggers outside his own comments.

And that's perfectly fine. There's no obligation.

It just means that he is not building a community.

### Consider the tricki.

Not only is it dead as he himself sadly noticed a while back. Like all other academic wikis, the tricki was never able to build a community to support itself. Yes, a few great mathematicians wrote a few great posts. But that is obviously not enough.

The case of academic wikis is especially sad as there is an incredibly successful wiki out there, wikipedia, that has succeeded. But the reason it succeeded was that it had leaders that invested in building a community, resolving conflicts, having an inclusive atmosphere for contributors both great and small.

### Consider the Polymath project.

Polymath was not a community building enterprise, it was, at its core, very old fashioned -- proof a very specific result and publish paper. Yes, the way to find collaborators was new. Yes, the experience was exciting. But it has only been repeated once and the key question is why.

From my perspective, it is (almost) dead. The problem with Polymath is that it failed to scale, that is, to build a community. Obviously, the community that it generated for its two successful runs could not simply move on to unrelated projects. Instead, each project needs a new community. And where should that come from?

If we can find a way to scale Polymath, then I think it will have to move in two directions. First, it must slow down that is, it must turn more [towards open notebook science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science). Second, it must deal with much smaller pieces. I mean the graph isomorphism problem? Maybe we could just encourage people to openly write about the problems they work on? Maybe even collaborate? I'm sure here at Booles' Rings we could start this. After all, if something is written here, there are a few witnesses in any fight for originality later -- and more importantly people that could give great feedback on your research problem.

### Consider the arXiv+MathOverflow idea

Again, Tim Gowers started a wonderful strong discussion about an important aspect of our community. And yet, nothing productive came out of it. Just like that failed Nature attempt years ago, everyone wants to read what other people think about papers, but nobody wants to write about it.

### Consider the ESPRC debacle

That was certainly one of the weirdest things happening on the web last year. It was fun to watch at first -- Tim Gowers took the lead, analyzed the website and spearheaded the criticism of essentially only giving grants to statistics post docs last year.

But it made me but wonder: how could that even happen? What is going on in the mathematical community in the UK to be caught by surprise that the major funding agency makes such a decision? Were they completely unaware of the inner workings of the major funding agency, in their very own field? Did they just not care? What on earth happened there??

### And anyway, are you kidding me?

The point is: Tim Gowers is great. But don't (ab)use him as an excuse not to do anything -- he's not that great (honestly!). The fact remains that, right now, nobody is working to build the mathematical community of the future, the online community.

As much as we can discuss the shortcomings of other people, it's you and me that must build that community. We must work to make polymath scale, we must review each others work publicly, we must share and engage and experiment.

If you think ESPRC and NSPRC are unimportant, you should probably consider why the NSF wants to change the name of its _Division of Mathematical Sciences_ to _Division of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences_. I think it's safe to say that we're all on the same track, regardless which (western) country we live in.

And it's about time to do more than just hope that Tim Gowers will save our ass. It's time to take responsibility within our scientific community that, for the first time in history, can become a democratic one.

But democracy needs much more work from all of us. So let's start writing, let's start talking to each other. So get a move on, sign up at wordpress.com or whatever and join the conversation -- it needs all our voices.

Let's beat that _selbstverschuldete Unmuendigkeit_ we're all suffering from and take responsibility for our community.
