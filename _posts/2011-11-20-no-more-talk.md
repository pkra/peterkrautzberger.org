> Dedicated to Scott.

I don't want to give a talk again.

You know what I mean.  
 Those talks, those damn talks  
 we sit through every day.  
 Those talks "I will present".  
 And then we talk and talk and talk  
 we lecture and lecture and lecture  
 repeating aloud what we should read.

I don't want to give a talk again.

I want to have a conversation.  
 You heard me.  
 A Conversation. I want to have it.  
 You say it needs two  
 at least  
 it does  
 but I can give, I can facilitate.

I'll send out word, ahead of time  
 notes to read, take a look.

And then we speak, converse, exchange.

Beyond correctness,  
 there's intuition  
 insight  
 understanding.

My thoughts might be sketchy  
 they're all I have.  
 I'll have my gaps  
 you will have yours.

I care for the core  
 the artistic  
 the truth.  
 my mathematics.

Meeting yours.
