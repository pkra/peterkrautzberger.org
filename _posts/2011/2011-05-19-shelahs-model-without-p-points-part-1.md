To get some research back into this blog, I will, over the course of the next few weeks, post some handwritten notes about a couple of well-known results by Shelah: the model without P-points, the model with a unique selective ultrafilter and the model with a unique P-point.

These notes were written for [my recent series of talks at the UofM’s Logic Seminar](http://settheory.mathtalks.org/university-of-michigan-logic-seminar/) here in Ann Arbor and came out of an ongoing collaboration with David Chodounsky from Prague. The source for this presentation is Shelah’s [Proper and Improper Forcing](http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.pl/1235419814).

The notes were written using [Xournal](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/).
