## What makes for a good birthday?

*   Cambridge in spring
*   everybody calling to wish a happy birthday
*   having a reason to go to [Dickson Brothers](http://dicksonbros.com/)
*   spending the day working on some research at [Petsi Pies](http://petsipies.com/)
*   understanding a proof by Saharon Shelah
*   finding out that the most recent “bug” on [mathblogging.org](http://www.mathblogging.org) is not critical.
*   sitting in the garden behind Barker Court
*   simplifying an argument of Shelah
*   being off for dinner with friends

Nice.
