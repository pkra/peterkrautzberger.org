I have written about why [I care about MathML](http://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0175/) and why I care about [Native MathML](http://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0176/).

Time to talk about some of the problems I have with MathML.  Please note I'm a member of the Math Working Group and I care deeply about MathML.

The problems I see are entirely focused on the web, the only domain where MathML struggles.

## Why I don't care about native MathML

MathML did not start out not as an XML language but simply as the `<math>` tag in HTML3 (yes, it looked very different but let's not forget this). It was the browser vendors (Microsoft and Netscape) who rejected it. So it went into XML exile, and returned as a (slightly second-class) HTML markup in HTML5.

But all OWP technologies stand and fall with the support and adoption from browser vendors. It does not matter how good (or bad) a web standard is or how well it works elsewhere. Browser vendor adoption is the only relevant measure. (Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty open as to how we get to browser vendor adoption of standards, including regulation.)

It's been almost two years since I started to write ["MathML forges on"](http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html).

Back then, native browser support seemed to be on the tipping point. Dave Barton had done amazing work on improving Alex Milowski's WebKit code, the deactivation in Chrome seemed to be a hiccup that was quickly fixed.

With a little luck, Gecko and WebKit would have made it to 80/20 point, hopefully in turn get the Blink team to reconsider dropping the WebKit code and then watch as Trident (now Edge) would hurry to integrate the math support from Line Services.

Two years later, MathML is still the only viable markup language for mathematics on the web, recently reaffirmed by its ISO standardization. And yet, native browser support seems just as far away as ever.

In the last two years, Gecko hasn't moved forward much (some under the hood improvements in early 2014), WebKit has barely moved, Trident/Edge remains a mystery, and Blink is "the villain".

Why?

## Who implements native MathML support?

WebKit's and Gecko's (still quite partial) support has been almost exclusively implemented by volunteer contributors, mostly unpaid. Mozilla is really the only company that has ever actively supported volunteers (via GSoC, with bug fixes and with design decisions). I doubt anyone at Apple even knows the MathML code in WebKit well enough to tell you how it roughly works.

In short, no browser vendor has ever worked on MathML support in their browser. (Yes, that's a bit unfair to Mozilla devs who are great -- sorry. There are also good people at Apple, Google, Microsoft; but the companies fail.)

The volunteers, on the other hand, come and go. Nobody is able to find significant funding. And development has been effectively dead for over a year now.

## Quo vadis, MathML?

So I'm giving up on native MathML support in browsers for now.

But that does not mean in any way that I'm giving up on MathML, let alone math and science notation on the web.
