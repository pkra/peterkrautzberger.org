# Why I don't really care about Native MathML

I have written about why [I care about MathML](/0175/) and why I care about [Native MathML](/0176/).

Time to talk about some of the problems I have with MathML.

These are personal thoughts, not indicative of the position of any project I might work on, in particular not the thoughts of the MathJax team.

So before you start thinking "this guys says MathML is bad, OMG it must be so bad / OMG he must be so evil", please note that I'm a member of the [W3C Math Working Group](http://www.w3.org/Math/) and I care deeply about MathML and the mission of the Math Working Group [to facilitate and promote the use of the Web for mathematical and scientific communication](http://www.w3.org/Math/Documents/Charter2006.html).

Also note that the problems I see are entirely focused on the web, the only domain where MathML continues to struggle.

## The rise and fall of MathML

MathML did not start out not as an XML language but as the `<math>` tag in HTML3. It was the browser vendors (Microsoft, Netscape) who rejected it so `<math>` went into XML exile and returned to HTML in HTML5.

But all OWP technologies stand and fall with the support and adoption from browser vendors. It does not matter how good (or bad) a web standard is or how well it works elsewhere. Browser vendor adoption is the only relevant measure.

# No news is not good news

It's been almost two years since I started to write ["MathML forges on"](http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/mathml-forges-on.html).

Back then, native browser support seemed to be on the tipping point. Dave Barton had done amazing work on improving Alex Milowski's WebKit code, the deactivation in Chrome seemed to be a hiccup that was quickly fixed. It seemed, with a little luck, Gecko and WebKit would have made it to the 80/20 point within a year, hopefully in turn get the Blink team to reconsider dropping the WebKit code and then watch as Trident (now Edge) would hurry to integrate the math support from Line Services.

Two years later, MathML is still the only viable markup language for mathematics on the web (recently reaffirmed by its ISO standardization), and yet, native browser support seems just as far away as ever. Gecko hasn't moved forward much, WebKit has barely moved, Trident/Edge remains a mystery, and Blink is "the villain".

Why?

## Who implements native MathML support?

WebKit's and Gecko's (still quite partial) support has been almost exclusively implemented by volunteer contributors (mostly unpaid volunteers at that).

No browser vendor has ever worked on MathML support in their browser. (Yes, that's a bit unfair to Mozilla devs who are great -- sorry. I also know good people at Apple, Google, Microsoft; it's the companies that still all fail to invest in MathML browser support.)

The volunteers, on the other hand, come and go. Nobody is able to find significant funding and development is, once again, effectively dead.

I'm afraid I don't see how we can ever get native MathML support in browsers. The volunteer method does not work and the vendors remain uninterested.

## Where could we go instead?

The fact that browser vendors do not implement MathML says virtually nothing about MathML. Studying past discussions, it's clear that there isn't a lot of knowledge about the spec or the requirements of mathematical layout. (Again, this is a little unfair to a (very) few individual devs.)

So I see no reason to give up on MathML, let alone math and science notation on the web. Because one thing has not changed: it's still the best markup for math on the web and education, industry, and research need good markup that works on the web.

Even without native browser implementations being a realistic goal, I think MathML can still be a trail blazer for scientific notation. It is, after all, a long standing W3C standard and we know it works very well in a browser context (even if you need polyfills).

I think there are two problems we can focus on that are just as useful to move scientific markup forward and the web in general forward:

1. how to do mathematical layout using the web standards that are actually being implemented (and how to improve both)
2. how to expose the underlying scientific markup such as MathML (but also CML, PhyloXML, CellML etc).

As opposed to native browser support for MathML, both of these are extremely feasible.

First, modern browsers (IE9+) are good enough to allow you to convert MathML "statically" into HTML or SVG markup so that the result provides the same layout on all browsers, comparable to TeX quality but naturally integrated into the surrounding content. To be clear, this is not (just) about client-side rendering like MathJax.

The only problem is that the necessary markup itself is horribly complicated and hard to generate -- just look at the spans-spans-spans MathJax generates. However, I think this situation is not unlike how grids using Bootstrap or Foundation are overly complicated compared to examples using css-grid layout. Or how doing flexbox-like layout is horribly complicated without flexbox.

I think we can and should focus on implemented standards and work on improving them so that the markup you need for good math layout becomes cleaner and thus easier to generate (both in terms of structure and performance).

Second, looking at the developments of the semantic web, it's obviously not being realized in terms of HTML tags or CSS propertiers. It is being realized via ARIA roles, RDFa, microdata etc. I'm not saying those are an immediate fit for the semantic structure of MathML (or math and science more generally) but something along those lines seems more realistic than waiting for <del>Godot</del> native browser support to come around. Frankly, I'm a bit tired of waiting; MathML is frozen because we're all waiting for native support which is simply not happening. Let's move forward.
