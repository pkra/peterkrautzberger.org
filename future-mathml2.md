I have written about why [I care about MathML](http://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0175/) and why I care about [Native MathML](http://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0176/).

Time to talk about some of the problems I have with MathML.  Please note I'm a member of the Math Working Group and I care deeply about MathML.

The problems I see are entirely focused on the web, the only domain where MathML struggles.

## Why I don't care about native MathML

MathML started out not as an XML language but simply as the `<math>` tag in HTML3. It was the browser vendors (Microsoft and Netscape) who rejected it. So it went into XML exile, and returned as a (slightly second-class) HTML markup in HTML5.

But all OWP technologies stand and fall with the support and adoption from browser vendors. It does not matter how great (or pathetic -- don't `<blink>` now) a web standard is or how well it works in some worlds or how super-duper-loving (or -hating) its fans are. Browser vendor adoption is the only goal.
