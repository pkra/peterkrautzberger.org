Apparently, I totally forgot to announce this anywhere on my interwebz!

With its [major code update](https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091827/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-new-features-and-new-editors/) three weeks ago, [scienceseeker.org](http://scienceseeker.org) introduced an editorial system where editors can mark particular posts and leave a small note -- and I was invited to become one of the fancy new editors (and given [my fellow editors](https://web.archive.org/web/20121029181018/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-our-new-slate-of-editors/) methinks I'm the n00b).

sciencseeker.org came out of [scienceblogging.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20110415043257/http://scienceblogging.org/) (originally dubbed its "v2.0"). (For those who remember, [Felix](http://www.felixbreuer.net), [Fred](http://boolesrings.org/vonheymann/) and I [originally](http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/about/) modeled [mathblogging.org](http://mathblogging.org) after scienceblogging.org.)

In fact, scienceseeker.org is much more like mathblogging.org in that it accepts every blog with (some) scientific content. So it was only natural to meet up with [Dave Munger](http://twitter.com/#!/davemunger) at [Science Online 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202353/http://scienceonline2012.com/) (which was another one of those great [#Scio12](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23scio12) conversations that just keep returning like a million boomerangs).

Now if you visited [sciencseeker.org](http://scienceseeker.org) a few weeks ago, you may have found its database to be somewhat lacking in mathematical blogs. To remedy that, the kind people at scienceseeker.org accepted a list of ~30 of my favorite blogs I simply exported out of mathblogging.org (did you know you can [download our database as csv and opml](https://web.archive.org/web/20120307135703/http://www.mathblogging.org/feeds)?).

So I hope I'll be doing a decent job (and you probably won't be surprised if my picks for scienceseeker.org might also appear on [our Mathblogging.org Weekly Picks](http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/category/weekly-picks/). You can follow the [Editors' Picks on scienceseeker.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://scienceseeker.org/displayfeed/?type=post&filter0=modifier&value0=editorsPicks) and on twitter [@sciseekeds](http://twitter.com/#!/SciSeekEds). I usually post a pick every other day and on Fridays.

  Congratulations, Peter!

  Congratulations!  
  Looking at the list of editors and their areas, I get the impression that science consists of the biological sciences plus some peripheral stuff.  So please do a great job representing our periphery.

  Thank you both, Andreas and François.
  Yes, the biological sciences dominate in blogging just like everywhere else in academia (last time I checked, extra-mural funding in the EU went to 40<span>%</span> to the life sciences with another 40<span>%</span> to engineering).
  But there’s a lot to learn from them, too. The way top bloggers help make the inner workings of their scientific community transparent is impressive — from being hired to being on hiring committees, from grant writing to grant panels from graduate student experiences to mentoring.
  Mathematical researcher bloggers are way behind when it comes to using blogs to help our community, especially the younger generations (math teachers on the other hand are quite impressive already).

  Andreas, we are looking to add some editors in the physical sciences. If you know anyone who you think would be good, send them our way — I’m @davemunger on twitter.

  Congrats (as the Chinese proverb says, be careful what you wish for :-)).
  One of the feature that was a little off putting when I initially looked at the earlier generation called v 2.0 was this need to connect posts to a peer review article.  I did not bother too much making that connection between their aggragtor and Nuit Blanche then.
  On Nuit Blanche, or any blogs relying on conferences/arxiv style prepublications, when it is peer reviewed, it is already too late and so I could not even mention any of my posts then because none of them would appear before “a certain time”. I also worried that my blog entries would not be taken seriously because there would never be a “peer reviewed article” stamp on these entries.  I wonder if the over-representation of life science articles  there is not directly related to this need of relying on peer-reviewed papers and I wonder how blogs that rely on arxiv/conferences/unreviewed presentation would fit into the more “explanational” nature of blog entries written on already published works.

  OK, not scientific – but equally important: HAPPY BIRTHDAY! lieber Peter.
  Liebe Grüsse aus Bonn, ich wünsche Dir einen herrlichen Tag und viele zufriedene Tage im kommenden Jahr.
  Mach et jot. Patrick
  * **Peter**, 2012/05/12
    Vielen Dank, Patrick. Grüße nach Bonn!
