In the everlasting "what I've said elsewhere" category, I haven't really written much about MathJax around here; MathJax as my job, that is. Perhaps I should do it more often.

Anyway, Fidus Writer is a very interesting open source project for academic, collaborative writing in the cloud, putting HTML first and providing LaTeX and epub3 output. They interviewed me (representing the MathJax team) and the result is now [on their blog](http://fiduswriter.com/2013/08/06/math-in-the-browser/).
