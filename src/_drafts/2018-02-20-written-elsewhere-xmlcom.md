As [I wrote earlier](/201/), there are a few things I've written elsewhere and I'd like to cross post (and archive here later).

It took a damn year to get from the first exchange with Lauren Wood to this post but it eventually did come out at [xml.com](https://xml.com): [Observations on equational content in XML workflows](https://www.xml.com/articles/2018/01/15/observations-equational-content-xml-workflows/). This is based on [my talk at XML Summer School 2017](https://pkra.github.io/xmlsummerschool2017/index.html).

You should totally [register](http://xmlsummerschool.com/) for XML Summer School 2018!
