I recently spoke to a young PI about mathematics compared to other research areas. This conversation struck me as odd as it provided plenty of anecdotal evidence regarding a development that worries me: the new breed of PIs in academia, adapted to the current climate in research.

What do I mean?

* hunt for grants  
 * Papers papers and more papers  
 * no convictions  
 * no outside the box == grant, papers, grant papers
