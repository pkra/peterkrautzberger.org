Finally, the discussion about what scientific publishing could look like in times of the internet is upon mathematics. The topic comes up frequently on sites with a science focus, yet mathematicians have largely ignored the issue.

There is a very simple reason for this: we have the arXiv and, thanks to the battles of many, strong self-archival rights along with it. So we're way ahead of most sciences in this respect.

Tim Gowers's post is strange, really. He raises two interesting questions

*   If we didn't have journals, what tool would we build now?
*   How could we get to this tools from our current system?

There's an obvious underlying point here: Gowers does not expect to end up with the current journal system. Unfortunately, he does not share why he believes this, oh well.

Full disclosure: I left a couple of detailed comments there but got no response and I could just be ranting because I feel ignored (that good old trolling motivation) -- I hope I won't. Actually, the opposite is true; the fact that Tim Gowers ignored my comments is in favor of what the small I'd like to make here.

A few commentators (in particular, the wondeful Gil Kalai) expressed that we shouldn't replace the journal system -- it's good the way it is.

What I'm trying to argue here is that regardless of whether anything is wrong with the journal system (see Noam Nissan's post http://agtb.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/the-problem-with-journals/) there's something else very wrong that we should focus on.

## What are journals for?

For the debate about journals, this should be the base question to ask.

There are at least two questions here. The scientific one is:

> What are journals for when it comes to advancing mathematical knowledge?

But I want to talk about a different one:

> What are journals for when it comes to organizing the scientific community?

and in particular,

> What are journals for when it comes to evaluating researchers, especially in the hiring process?

### A simple answer?

From what I understand (arguably, as a puny first-time postdoc), the answer to the last question is:

> Journals are the only tool taken seriously for the evaluation of a researcher.

I think this is a problem. I know that many application processes in the world now require

One of the replies I got to my comments at Tim Gowers's was that there was a need to deal with 600 applicants to a single position.

This comment made me sad. Not that I don't think it was an honest and serious comment. Rather, it was the implication that the key feature of any system must be to weed out applicants. I can understand that this is a problem, but I cannot understand that this is an argument for the current journal system

### The academic oligarchy

Not just a few commentators praised a special quality of "top" journals: they are controlled by "top" researchers. This is an interesting issue, since it points to something everybody accepts in academia: the scientific community is organized as an oligarchy. It makes me wonder if the internet might not allows us to turn the scientific community into a democracy. Yes, there will be cranks, but as societies we feel confident enough to be able to tolerate extremists, should cranks really be an argument for an oligarchy?

# NEW START

What made this debate so weird for me was that most blog posts have somewhere some small tidbit that points into a totally different direction. I am hoping this is because all these writers believe that this is important. But I'm confused why all decided to make this is a sidenote.

### We're only valuing one activity

I have made this point before: my main problem with journals is not the way they work (I have a problem with this because peer review is essentially broken and because its an oligarchic system).

My problem is the value the mathematical community assigns to them. The only way researchers are evaluated is by looking at the publication record in traditional journals. This is a wasteful way. I can understand how this system made sense historically -- before modern communication we needed serious gate-keeping because dissemination was expensive.

Unfortunately, the changing academic system has led to publish-or-perish. Again, I understand those that created the pressure -- the people actually paying for research, i.e., in democracies: the people, wanted to know if they are paying for the best people.

Just as deeply as I believe that scientific endeavours must be financed by the public, I deeply believe that we must be provide responsible and transparent evaluation of researchers that get this funding.

What I dislike is the amount of publishing that is needed. I have heard and I have seen too many papers that shouldn't have been published. I have seen many papers whose actual content was ridiculously small (in the worst cases, blown out of proportion by dubious writing) or their quality was miserable (because mathematical writing is not about communication but getting-it-passed-the-referee). I have also seen many papers that clearly hid additional information because the authors needed to hide it for the continuation of the paper (but could get two, three, four publications this way).

Note that I'm not really talking about the glamour magazines of mathematics (Inventiones etc) -- which, sad to say, is because my field never has a paper in those, that's how dead it has become. Maybe it's all happy-awesomesauce there, but I doubt it.

Some people argue that only journals can give peer-review. I think this is plainly wrong. Just look at the classic response on a science blog regarding one of those St.Kerns' -- if you're a successful blogger you won't see the end of it when you make a mistake.

It also assumes that we couldn't seek out peer-review on our own -- which is plain wrong. If I send a copy of a paper to a colleague I respect and I know has an expertise in the topic, I have a better chance of getting a true review.

All of these come down to a question about our community.

Do we really want to reduce researchers to impact factors and citation indices? And, assuming the current system is even slightly out of balance, can we not get both at the same time: fix the system by relieving it of some of the pressure that we put on it as an evaluation tool.

### Fixing the journal system by adding alternatives.

### Another try

Here's my experience with the journal system. First of all, almost all papers that I have read in my academic life were badly written, barely using the logical method, poorly typeset or made appear more original than they really were.

I don't really blame the authors (well, maybe a little). Whenever I read such a paper I sigh and I think about our system. It's often called peer-review but the true name is publish-or-perish.

I understand that you cannot get a job, a grant or any kind of respect in the community these days without publishing a lot of papers with "new" results. We mathematicians have our own private decline effect. The pressure to publish continues to lower the least publishable unit. We need to publish and we need to publish new(-looking) results.

It has made us dishonest.

I know that there are great minds out there. But let's face it, we're catching up with our philosophy brethren. Just like hardly any researcher in philosophy deserves the title philosopher so do few mathematicians deserve the title mathematician. Luckily, in mathematics we still have more than a handful of mathematicians per generation, but most researchers do good honest work which is not that spectacular.

We're like to say that mathematics is an art. I think it's true, though we're a very different art and we're very bad at allowing people to consume our art.

But we do not make money with our art, there's no Picasso's or Warhol's that can live off their mathematical work. Instead we are researchers -- and above all teachers. This is what allows us to pursue our art: teaching. Because anybody acquiring even a basic understanding of mathematics is simply smarter than people who have not acquired mathematical knowledge. It's just like the arts: you don't have to become a mathematician to gain from mathematical knowledge, just like you don't have to become a musician to grow your faculties by engaging in music. It is enough to engage. And we mathematicians offer this with our teaching.

Teaching is the single strongest claim to our existence. People like to quote all the wonderful examples of pure mathematics that found it's way into applications centuries later. The truth is, it's a facade. It tries to deflect our fellow citizens critical questions why they should give us the money to practice mathematics without limitations, to live our dream. It deflects it by saying: just wait, it's always turned out to be important in 100 years. It works well and nobody asks us if we can't achieve something in 75 or even 50 years maybe.

We also weaken ourselves when we forget to point out all the mathematically trained professionals throughout our societies. Mathematics makes you smarter and more successful in live. It is an incredible thing to have something so abstract have such a practical effect on people's lives. Again, we're an art. But we have nothing to hide.

Because few of us are Picasso I think it is ridiculous to ask every mathematician to be as productive as a Picasso (or an Erdos maybe). But that's what we're essentially doing.

We have allowed our existence as reseachers to be reduced to the number of publications. More grievously, we have allowed our existence to be reduced to the number of "new" results. It is perilous that our community values new results over understanding of mathematics. I loved Nisan's posts, but I cringe when I read "non-research" as a description of overview articles, expository articles, textbooks, wikipedia articles, blogposts or social media activities.

I admit those things do not fall under "new results published in a journal". But we're damaging the future of our field if we think we can continue to ignore the drift created by this development.

Simply put, we need is fewer papers so that we can have better papers. Better papers need more time, more care and a completely different attitude towards mathematical writing, even thinking. One cannot find any vision of what mathematical writing and communication can look like in 21st century. The possibilities are frightening, the change could be as dramatic as the introduction of public journals in the 17th century.

It scares many people, especially those that have worked hard to fit into the system, that have invested a huge amount of energy to game the system. Changing the system means these people have less chances to become or stay mathematicians.

But on the other side are all the people that have left mathematics because of this system, because they had too much self-respect to game the system, who knew they couldn't compete in this game of writing good looking papers.

Most of the people defending the current system tend to be mediocre researchers. This isn't surprising. I cannot imagine a system that would prevent the greatest talents from surfacing. And I cannot imagine a system where the worst mathematicians suddenly rise to the top.

It really amuses me how people are worried about cranks. Do we really expect there to develop a system in which cranks can actually rise to "power"? Cranks are not the problem, the mediocre mathematicians are.

I don't mean mediocre as something negative, quite the opposite. The famous quote speaks of standing on the shoulders of giants. This is a joke. Most research is not done by the giants, it is done by the mediocre researchers, it is the mass of researchers that allow the giants to focus their energies on the toughest of problems and this mass, with its small success and it's massive failures lays the ground on which a successful solution of a problem can finally rise.

Mediocre talents are the most important researchers. At the moment, however, among those mediocre talents the journals system prefers one kind, the kind that can produce the right type of papers at the right time of life.

Many people believe that mathematics is a young person's game. There's really no evidence to that since the journal system effectively eliminates anyone who cannot produce the right kind of research at a young age.

The problem is, in one word, a problem of our scientific community. We give priority to the wrong abilities: writing papers that look good.

We are not better than stubborn school teachers that do not want to change the syllabus because it would mean they would have to learn something new.

Again, the problem is not the true mathematicians, the few great minds. Surprisingly often they do more than just research, they have uncanny abilities in teaching and communicating our field -- although mostly towards other other mathematicians.

The problem is the ruling class within the mediocre researchers. Like all sciences we live in an oligarchy. Just like oligarchies in our general societies, these make sense when a community is much too scattered to establish a functioning democracy. It was hard before the age of modern personal communication to communicate, to connect. We needed strong gate-keepers to minimize the costs of staying in touch, we needed page-limits in journals and important conferences once a year or less.

This has all changed. We can now build a democracy. Nisan finds the oligarchic structure valuable: it's good to know that the top journals have the top mathematicians and publishing there can really guarantee you better chances with a job or a grant.

But of course we all agree that this is a terrible way to organize society. Democracy is hard, but we all agree that it is better than oligarchy or even aristocracy (which might be even more adequate in describing mathematics -- just look up good researchers genealogy).

In particular, the current oligarchy does not just consist of those researchers I praise, those true mathematicians, with amazing, really new results and great exposition.

The oligarchy is rather firmly in the hand of those mediocre mathematicians who are successful in the current system. They look down on exposition or efforts of communicating because they are only good at one thing: writing papers suitable for the current system.

I'm not saying these people are not important -- they are. Rather, they are not all that is important. They represent, in a manner of speaking, only a part of what makes a great mathematician. The other parts are, however, not valued.

This is what we need to change.

And we should start right away. Just like the English professor who finally moved his front-page wikipedia articles to the research section of his tenure report we need to do what we're good at and say so. Put your work on your cv.

In a way, this democratic society is already building itself on the internet. I see it every day. The blogosophere is largely looked down upon, but it is an incredible community. The work you find there is beyond anything you can ever find in a journal. The interactions are open, communication is transparent, exchanges rapid.

In other words, the change is already on its way.

The oligarchs of research can only decide on the speed. Will they embrace this new society, this potential democracy of scientists? The alternative seems bleak.

In the face of the cuts in the UK and Canada, it is clear the the leadership of our community is failing miserably. How could the leader of the mathematical community in the UK not even be aware of the ridiculous cuts the EPSRC suddenly implemented?

In the US, the subtle change of the NSF section is most likely a first sign of a similar development. The mathematical community is failing to communicate its strengths and importance to the rest of our societies. This is our leaders fault, and thus our own since we tolerate the leadership of people only judged by their publication record.
