### Evening and banquet

*   conversation with jason (micro-journal, invisible college, service-college), jennifer, martin
*   banquet with Krist Holmes, Martin Fenenr
*   great story-telling
*   then hotel bar until 2:30pm

After I posted this on google+ yesterday, I thought I'd make this thought more official.

Dear Tim Gowers,

Last year, your posted a piece on your blog that spawned a rich discussion in the mathematical blogosphere. In it you described how to reform publishing, favoring a combination of MathOverflow and arXiv. Recently you've brought up the topic again by publicly announced that you're boycotting Elsevier.

However, very little actually came out of that discussion. A few kind words, a few angry words, a lot of hot air.

It might be that you and a few secret collaborators are working intensely on a project to realize the vision you described. Since such secrecy would probably oppose the thought behind such a democratization of our community, I'm reasonably sure this is not the case. Then again, your approach was rather centralized as opposed to the decentralized idea of a democratic web-of-trust, so maybe a benevolent-dictator approach would be more natural. In short, I don't know and I'm guessing nobody knows.

What strikes me as extremely strange, however, is the fact that there was no reaction to the fact that most of the functionality you were describing already exists in some form or another.

For example, researchblogging.org is aimed at catching blog posts about peer-reviewed research (but also arXiv preprints). More specifically, papercritic.com is a platform for reviewing individual papers. More generally speaking, the altmetrics community has created tools such as PLoS's alternative metrics, totalimpact.com, readermeter.org and sciencecard. There are Google Scholar, Microsoft Researcher and VIVO profiles.

In other words, there's a rich community out there that works extremely hard to actually take the step into a different world of academic publishing.

Very little is heard from mathematical researchers on such projects.

In other words, we are just seeing the mathematical version of _Nature_'s failed post-publication peer-review attempt? That is, everyone wants such reviews but nobody is willing to talk openly what they think of other people's writing.

Allow me to end with a simple question:

Would you do what you suggested in the first place and start commenting on other people's papers publicly?

I cannot stress how important it was that you used your authority and reach to bring this topic to a lacking audience. But after a lot of talk, it's time to take action.

Most sincerely,  
 Peter Krautzberger.
