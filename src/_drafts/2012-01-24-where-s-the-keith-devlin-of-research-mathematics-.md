For the set theorists in the room, the title is somewhat of a pun (intended). If you may or may not know, Keith Devlin used to be a set theorist, in fact, the very first paper I ever read was his (and Shelah's) and, personally, I admire him deeply on many levels.

But he's left set theory behind a long time ago and does even more excellent research in mathematics education -- and, maybe more importantly writes great popular mathematics books.

I just watched this panel discussion between Keith Devlin, Dan Meyer, and Karim Ani.

Keith Devlin does a rather long introduction (he seems to like to listen to himself, but who can blame him). Around ~8min into the video, he talks how he "found" Dan Meyer and Karim Ani.

And then he shows how much he's helped them along, engaging, encouraging, connecting. Now they sit with him on this panel.

As you know, I just got back from Science Online 2012\. Throughout Scio12, I found myself having mixed feelings. On the one hand, mathematics online has nowhere near the visibility of science, even though we're ahead in some things (like the arXiv and MathOverflow). On the other hand, we are safe from the horrors that come with it such as misquotations, trolls, unreasonable politicians, ad-hominem attacks, or threats to our lives.

If I look into the blogosphere of research mathematics (which I look into a lot for the editorial work we do at [mathblogging.org](http://www.mathblogging.org)), I see not only no equal, but nobody even trying what he does. Yes, Tim Gowers is one the greatest mathematical bloggers, Terry Tao does many amazing things for researchers (but hardly anything for the general public).

But nobody out there tries to engage, encourage or connect young researchers.

Who could do it? Well, in different way, John Baez does it. In some ways, the AMS grad student blog used to do it (before graduation eliminated a lot of good contributors), in a different way Igor Carron does it. I could go on.

I guess what I'm saying is that we really need a blogging network. We need some actual leadership (something our community is greatly lacking in general, incidentally).
