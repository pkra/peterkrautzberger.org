No, no, don't worry. This is not about the inconsistency of Peano Arithmetic or other [pseudo-crises in the history of logic](http://www.gender.hu-berlin.de/forschung/publikationen/gender-bulletins/texte-32/texte32pkt2).

This is about something much more serious, a political crisis, a leadership crisis and a followership crisis. In short, an ethical crisis of mathematics.
