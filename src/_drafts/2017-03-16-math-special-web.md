Holy shit, it's been a long time since I wrote anything over here.

Here are two simple convictions I hold that seem difficult to get across at times. 

1. Mathematics does not need special treatment on the web.
2. Mathematics does not deserve special treatment on the web.

The first is a simple reality, I think. Putting mathematical content on the web in perfect and universal quality is not hard today and it is only getting easier as web technology continues to evolve. And I don't mean endless arrays of client-side solutions here but simple "static" content.

It might not yet be easy to scale every detail today (e.g., perfectly accessible rendering) but the complexity has dropped so rapidly in the last few years that you have to be very disconnected from web development (and math-on-web tech specifically) to not expect the gap to close in a few years. Besides, the greatest challenges I see are just general challenges for the web (e.g., providing Braille).

In fact, not only are there many products out there that help you solve it, usually for free, you can also find an increasing number of hobbyist projects that get a decent quality (though usually focused on a particular niche).

The only trouble that remains is people who think that math does need special treatment for some moral reason. I've seen a couple of forms of this.

a) The a but-it-is-a-standard person. "But X is a standard (whatever that means) and it should be the only thing people can use".

This usually comes from MathML fans and it is stupid. Even if MathML was implemented, it continues to be a bad standard that neither specifies layout nor semantics in a suitable way for the web. And even if it's a standard (despite its working group shutting down last year), there are other standards. 

Sure, many people don't understand that `<math><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>` in no way superior to `a<sup>2</sup>` but nobody thinks the latter isn't "standard".

b) The we-had-a-deal person. "I once invested in this one tech (usually, MathML) because people told me it was the future; I can't accept anything else."

I get the frustration of these people. There's nothing wrong with having invested in MathML outside the web (and even with the web in mind). But that investment was usually driven by gains in non-web content (e.g., print) and it paid out. How can it be shocking that maybe you didn't kill two birds with one stone? The only failure I've seen repeatedly in this space is to fail to invest in new tech that builds on your successful investment.

b) The Kool Aid person ("I once saw this really great tool that, given perfectly prepared content, gave incredibly perfect results and whatever you mean it doesn't give me that").
