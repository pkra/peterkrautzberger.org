  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2012-04-21">21 Apr 2012</time></span>
  <p>Apparently, I totally forgot to announce this anywhere on my interwebz!</p>
<p>With its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091827/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-new-features-and-new-editors/">major code update</a> three weeks ago, <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">scienceseeker.org</a> introduced an editorial system where editors can mark particular posts and leave a small note -- and I was invited to become one of the fancy new editors (and given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121029181018/http://scienceseeker.org/news/2012/04/03/introducing-our-new-slate-of-editors/">my fellow editors</a> methinks I'm the n00b).</p>
<p><a href="http://sciencseeker.org">sciencseeker.org</a> came out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110415043257/http://scienceblogging.org/">scienceblogging.org</a> (originally dubbed its "v2.0"). (For those who remember, <a href="http://www.felixbreuer.net">Felix</a>, <a href="http://boolesrings.org/vonheymann/">Fred</a> and I <a href="http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/about/">originally</a> modeled <a href="http://mathblogging.org">mathblogging.org</a> after <a href="http://scienceblogging.org">scienceblogging.org</a>.)</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">scienceseeker.org</a> is much more like <a href="http://mathblogging.org">mathblogging.org</a> in that it accepts every blog with (some) scientific content. So it was only natural to meet up with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davemunger">Dave Munger</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202353/http://scienceonline2012.com/">Science Online 2012</a> (which was another one of those great <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23scio12">#Scio12</a> conversations that just keep returning like a million boomerangs).</p>
<p>Now if you visited <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">sciencseeker.org</a> a few weeks ago, you may have found its database to be somewhat lacking in mathematical blogs. To remedy that, the kind people at <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">scienceseeker.org</a> accepted a list of ~30 of my favorite blogs I simply exported out of <a href="http://mathblogging.org">mathblogging.org</a> (did you know you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120307135703/http://www.mathblogging.org/feeds">download our database as csv and opml</a>?).</p>
<p>So I hope I'll be doing a decent job (and you probably won't be surprised if my picks for <a href="http://scienceseeker.org">scienceseeker.org</a> might also appear on <a href="http://mathblogging.wordpress.com/category/weekly-picks/">our Mathblogging.org Weekly Picks</a>. You can follow the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://scienceseeker.org/displayfeed/?type=post&filter0=modifier&value0=editorsPicks">Editors' Picks on scienceseeker.org</a> and on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SciSeekEds">@sciseekeds</a>. I usually post a pick every other day and on Fridays.</p>

Congratulations, Peter!</li>
<li><strong>Andreas Blass</strong>, 2012/04/22<br>
Congratulations!<br>
Looking at the list of editors and their areas, I get the impression that science consists of the biological sciences plus some peripheral stuff.  So please do a great job representing our periphery.</li>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2012/04/23<br>
Thank you both, Andreas and François.<br>
Yes, the biological sciences dominate in blogging just like everywhere else in academia (last time I checked, extra-mural funding in the EU went to 40<span>%</span> to the life sciences with another 40<span>%</span> to engineering).<br>
But there’s a lot to learn from them, too. The way top bloggers help make the inner workings of their scientific community transparent is impressive — from being hired to being on hiring committees, from grant writing to grant panels from graduate student experiences to mentoring.<br>
Mathematical researcher bloggers are way behind when it comes to using blogs to help our community, especially the younger generations (math teachers on the other hand are quite impressive already).</li>
<li><strong>Dave Munger</strong>, 2012/04/24<br>
Andreas, we are looking to add some editors in the physical sciences. If you know anyone who you think would be good, send them our way — I’m @davemunger on twitter.</li>

Congrats (as the Chinese proverb says, be careful what you wish for :-)).<br>
One of the feature that was a little off putting when I initially looked at the earlier generation called v 2.0 was this need to connect posts to a peer review article.  I did not bother too much making that connection between their aggragtor and Nuit Blanche then.<br>
On Nuit Blanche, or any blogs relying on conferences/arxiv style prepublications, when it is peer reviewed, it is already too late and so I could not even mention any of my posts then because none of them would appear before “a certain time”. I also worried that my blog entries would not be taken seriously because there would never be a “peer reviewed article” stamp on these entries.  I wonder if the over-representation of life science articles  there is not directly related to this need of relying on peer-reviewed papers and I wonder how blogs that rely on arxiv/conferences/unreviewed presentation would fit into the more “explanational” nature of blog entries written on already published works.</li>

OK, not scientific – but equally important: HAPPY BIRTHDAY! lieber Peter.<br>
Liebe Grüsse aus Bonn, ich wünsche Dir einen herrlichen Tag und viele zufriedene Tage im kommenden Jahr.<br>
Mach et jot. Patrick

Vielen Dank, Patrick. Grüße nach Bonn!</li>
