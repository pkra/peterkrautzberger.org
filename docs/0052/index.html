  <h1 class="post-title">Punkmath, annotatr and gender discussions</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-01-31">31 Jan 2011</time></span>
  <p>So last week was pretty abysmal as I spent most of the time in bed with a cold like I haven’t had in a while. Since this led to a major shutdown of my brain I failed to do anything useful. Whenever it didn’t burn a hole in my brain I did read a few interesting things.</p>
<h2>Punkmath</h2>
<p>I seem to be both late and early to the party. I cannot quite reconstruct how I ended up reading about Tom Henderson’s projects, so this is rather random. He co-hosts the frakkin’ cool podcast <a href="http://www.mathforprimates.com/">Math for Primates</a> together with <a href="http://www.sapiengames.com/">Nick Horton</a>, there’s <a href="http://www.mathpunk.net/">mathpunk.net</a> and <a href="http://punkmathematics.com/">punk mathematics</a> and finally he can be found <a href="http://twitter.com/mathpunk">on twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that all of Tom’s projects (apart from his twitter account) seem currently dormant while he writes a book — a book that <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1541803748/punk-mathematics">he financed via kickstarter</a> with an incredible USD28.000+ raised after aiming for a goal of USD2.400! That’s just absolutely mind-boggling to me. You can read an interesting <a href="http://technoccult.net/archives/2010/02/25/the-punk-rock-philosophy-of-mathematics-technoccult-interviews-tom-henderson/">interview with him on technoccult</a> if you don’t have the time to listen to the podcasts (if you find the podcast’s topics all too familiar when it comes to topics for popularizing mathematics I would still argue you should check out their awesome style).</p>
<h2>annotatr</h2>
<p>So a while ago there was <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/51056/are-there-any-good-websites-for-hosting-discussions-of-mathematical-papers">an interesting mathoverflow question on discussing mathematical papers online</a> that was (of course) closed immediately but Ben Webster managed to revive it and it actually got some fascinating answers.</p>
<p>Besides the trouble that mathoverflow still has when it comes to long term development of questions, there were not only the favoured power user answers describing a potential system — there were <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-websites-where-one-can-post-commentary-and-reviews-of-academic-papers">actual pointers to such projects</a>! What caught my eye immediately was, as you’ll understand, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110301214716/http://annotatr.appspot.com/">annotatr [Wayback Machine]</a>.</p>
<p>Annotatr is a sleeping beauty of a project. Hosted on the Google App Engine with <a href="https://github.com/mreid/annotatr">open sourced code on github</a> it makes you heart delight. Also, the simplicity of the idea is wonderful — combine citeulike with disqus, done.</p>
<p>Alas, it’s not working well so far. On the one hand the code hasn’t seen an update in half a year, on the other, there’s lack of a community. If mathblogging allows for it, I’d love to get acquainted with the code. I think if someone <a href="https://github.com/mreid/annotatr/issues">solves issues 2 and 3</a> it would be easy to get more people engaged.</p>
<h2>Gender bias at mathematical conferences</h2>
<p>A discussion took place at <a href="http://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/gendered-conference-campaign/">quomodocumque</a> the other day. I wish I could say I was surprised by the early comments but I was glad to read all the good counter arguments to the displayed ignorance. I haven’t got around posting my 2 cents. I’ll write more here once I get around posting there (which I plan after getting Ivelisse Rubio’s <span class="caps">MLK</span>-day talk online on the department’s website). But you should really read it and join the discussion.</p>
