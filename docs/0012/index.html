  <p>After too many weeks of silence and almost two weeks in the States it is definitely time for an update.<br>
The first 10 days at the <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> were taken up mostly by bureaucracy but some old and some new ideas have evolved out of my first two meetings with <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/">Andreas Blass</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand he has renewed his interest in the forcing construction of a non-Ramsey ultrafilter that <a href="http://math.ucalgary.ca/profiles/claude-laflamme">Claude Laflamme</a> did under his supervision back in the 80s. In fact (spoiler alert) Andreas will talk about such things at the <a href="http://www.aslonline.org/Meetings.htm">ASL Meeting in Washington</a> this week.</p>
<p>On my related part I have resumed work on constructing an unstable union ultrafilter which Andreas and I once had hoped to relate to the Laflamme forcings but later turned out not to. Mostly I spent time recovering my old strategies and had lots of them shot down by Andreas. Nevertheless I see progress there and look forward to spending more time on the issue (and hopefully blog about it, too).</p>
<p>Blog related the great change is finally coming up. I will switch to <a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">blogofile</a>, a blog compiler for static blogging, after I find a good place to host the new blog. I plan to switch to <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> for better MathML support and use <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for comments. This will simplify my publishing process and I hope it will lead to more frequent posts. After all I have not done enough writing so that it comes naturally to me.</p>
