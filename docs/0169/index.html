  <h1 class="post-title">Tiny blogging challenge</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2014-11-03">03 Nov 2014</time></span>
  <p>This year hasn't exactly been great in terms of my blogging. Because life. After the Red Workbook concept tapered off I barely managed 1 post per month.</p>
<p>Still, I miss writing. So I'm setting myself a tiny blogging challenge for the few weeks remaining in 2014.</p>
<ul>
<li>write 1 post per week</li>
<li>and spend less than 30 minutes on a post</li>
</ul>
<h2>just one per week?</h2>
<p>Yes. I don't want to take on a 1-post-a-day challenge because, well, I'd simply fail. I'm no Cathy O'Neill. So most likely I'll write these posts on the weekend or possibly late at night.</p>
<p>One post per week seems reasonable. It's realistic, I've done it in the past yet it's far from what I'm currently able to do.</p>
<h2>30 minutes per post?</h2>
<p>Not a lot, I admit, but the averaging napping time of certain person. Given that my usual writing includes a procrastination phase of 5-6 months I'm expecting a change in quality. I'm just hoping for an improvement, given that more writing regularly should mean more practice.</p>
<h2>about what?</h2>
<p>I thought it might be prudent to have a couple of topics ready so that when I sit down (not unlikely on a Sunday at 11:30pm to make the deadline) I have a last resort for a topic to babble about.</p>
<ul>
<li>write a post about the blogging challenge (score!)</li>
<li>LaTeX The Phantom Menace</li>
<li>MathJax best practices: webfonts for text</li>
<li>LaTeX something something dark side</li>
<li>LaTeX the markdown for math</li>
<li>Why you should care about MathML</li>
<li>Why you shouldn't care about MathML</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are not actually related to drafts or even proper ideas. They are just ideas I jotted down over the past few weeks.</p>

I dare you to sit and just type for 30 minutes straight. Real words, although syntax and grammar matter less here.<br>
Bonus points if it ends up a new and short proof of the equiconsistency between an inner model with a measurable and the existence of precipitous ideals.</li>

I would be interested in doing this too!<br>
Care to make it a little challenge? Along the lines of “the first person to go a week without posting donates some amount to the charity of the other’s choice?”<br>
Or are you all “talk” and no “walk”. :)

Hm… I would take on that challenge but I hesitate because I remember being very restricted financially as a grad student. I don’t want to add to that.</li>
