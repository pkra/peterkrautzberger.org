  <h1 class="post-title">Epub and mathematics</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-07-13">13 Jul 2011</time></span>
  <p>A while ago <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">Martin Fenner had written about the BeyondPDF workshop</a> and <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/01/epub-wordpress-plugin-released-today/">released his epub export plugin for wordpress</a> and <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/04/discussing-wordpress-for-scientists/">started the Wordpress For Scientist Google group</a>.</p>
<p>I had joined that group right away and had wanted to do some experiments for a while now. I have been falling in love with wordpress more and more and I will probably switch rather sooner than later. Then <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/ebook-geometry-and-the-absolute-point-v0-1">last week Lieven le Bruin released some of his posts as PDF</a> and, upon my comments, also experimented with epub. But the discussion on his blog brought back the issue of mathematics in epub.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m also starting another experiment – writing a paper collaboratively using wordpress! This will hopefully mean I can share more experiences. The main tool for this is <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> – a great tool for document conversion, especially if, like me, you love <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. Pandoc will eventually help me convert markdown to LaTeX (for the final touches). I’ll write more about that at some other point.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I finally got around to experimenting with epub and wrote the following lines on the google group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi.<br>
I have been experimenting with Martin’s epub-export plugin and, as a mathematician, can’t really be happy. There seems to be no good way to export mathematics in the sense that I (and most others online) are too used to LaTeX syntax and MathJax these days.<br>
From what I understand, the current situation is that the epub standard has a “should not”-rule for javascript inclusion and almost all applications block javascripts.<br>
This might possibly change in the future since the epub3 draft contains a “could”-rule for javascript. From a math(jax) point of view, javascript would solve a lot of issues. So I had wanted to experiment for some time and finally got around to it – so I thought I should share this.</p>
<p>A while ago I found <a href="http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2011/06/javascript-accepted-in-ibookstore.html">a promising story about javascript in epub</a>. In particular, javascript seems to work in the iPad’s ebook app.<br>
Today, I tried to use this knowledge to create some easy mathematics in epub and testing this with a friend’s iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">Asciimathml</a> inclusion “just worked” in the sense that adding the javascript file and adding the suitable line in the header of my test epub’s chap1.xhtml worked in the iPad app.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#loading-mathjax-from-the-cdn">MathJax inclusion via the CDN</a> worked – that’s great news, since it keeps the file small (but somewhat disturbing since it means all kinds of evils are possible via external javascript)</li>
<li>MathJax inclusion in the epub file failed. This is unfortunate. The size of the epub increases significantly (and the process takes ages with the 30.000 mathjax files), but from what I understand the file limit is 2GB, not 16MB…</li>
</ul>
<p>So I have three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Could anybody try to reproduce this?</li>
<li>Does anybody have thoughts on the problem of actual inclusion of mathjax?</li>
<li>Does anybody know an ebook reader outside of the ipad that tolerates javascript?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions! Peter.</p>
