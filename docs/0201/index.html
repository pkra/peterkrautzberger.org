  <p>I miss writing here; alot. I technically wrote twice as much here in 2017 than in 2016 (and up to No. 200) but it was still less than once a month; it became hard at some point. I used to be able to blame my work <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">for MathJax</a> because I was (at times) writing a lot for the project; I don't have that particular excuse <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathjax-dev/k48Q0NxiNoU/BRYlaDuaCAAJ">anymore</a>.</p>

<p>I've never been one for looking back at the end of a year. But since the last year was complex (and this one is set up to be equally so) I thought maybe I should motivate myself by looking ahead to the things I want to write about this year (including things in my actual schedule for 2018).</p>
<ul>
<li>wrap up the series &quot;The Problem with MathML as a web standard&quot;, my 10,000ft view of MathML's flaws.
<ul>
<li>this has taken far too much time already and I've started to hate coming back to it because of all the negativity around MathML (both the spec and the community).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>think about my upcoming workshop on equation rendering in ebooks at <a href="http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/speakers/">Ebookcraft in March</a> (you should totally <a href="http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/register/">register</a>!)</li>
<li>think about the workshop I'm co-organizing at AIM on <a href="https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/webmath/">web accessibility of mathematics in May</a></li>
<li>reminisce about my time at MathJax which shaped the past 5 years of my life
<ul>
<li>in particular, write about MathJax v3 a bit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>write about the future of equation rendering on the web as I think it could unfold
<ul>
<li>maybe wonder a bit about the future of real STEM content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>write up some thoughts and experiments from last year on how the web can (should and probably will) replace LaTeX for most people</li>
<li>write down some observations from a workshop on authoring accessible STEM content for the web which I did together with <a href="https://twitter.com/bfisseler">Björn Fisseler</a> at FernUni Hagen last year.</li>
<li>status updates for <a href="https://mathblogging.org">mathblogging.org</a> and <a href="https://boolesrings.org">boolesrings.org</a></li>
<li>write about <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/journalsframework/AMSMathViewer">AMS MathViewer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, maybe stop here; it's a lot already.</p>
