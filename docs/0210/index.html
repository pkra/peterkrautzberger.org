  <h1 class="post-title">Carnival of Math No. 173</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2019-09-12">12 Sep 2019</time></span>
  <p>This year I <a href="/0194/">once again</a> have the pleasure to host the now <strong>173th Carnival of Mathematics</strong>, the moveable feast of mathematical blogging shepherded by <a href="http://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/">The Aperiodical</a>, the best math blogging collective on this little blue ball in space. Be sure to <a href="https://leeyieng.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/carnival-of-mathematics-172/">visit the previous Carnival (No. 172) at Cassandra Lee Yieng's blog</a> and keep an eye on <a href="https://aperiodical.com/carnival-of-mathematics/">all Carnivals</a>.</p>
<p>As tradition will have it, we begin our show by taking a closer look at our number.</p>
<p><strong>173</strong> is not just a prime, the sum of two squares of primes (2²+13²) <em>and</em> the sum of three primes (53+59+61). No, it is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_prime">balanced prime</a> (same gap to previous and following prime) and the 13<sup>th</sup>(!) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain_prime">Sopie Germain prime</a> (since 2×173+1=347 is also prime).</p>

<img width="256" style="margin: 0 auto;" alt="Sophie Germain" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Germain.jpeg">
<figcaption>Portrait of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain">Sophie Germain</a> (April 1, 1776 - June 27, 1831), <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Germain.jpeg">[Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alas, 173 is also an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_number">odious number</a>, which may sound rather bad but just means it has an odd number of 1's in binary (10101101).</p>
<p>Now that you've warmed up, let us once again enter the decidely wonderful, balanced madness of the mathematical blogging carnival.</p>
<hr>
<p>Likely most people (or at least the most people) will already have seen the NYT's Kenneth Chang looking into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/science/math-equation-pemdas.html">Why Mathematicians hate that viral equation</a>; but really who needs 8÷2(2+2) when you can so easily have drama with the Oxford Comma.</p>
<p>In any case, make sure you head over to Over at the Art of Research where Vi Hart shared <a href="https://theartofresearch.org/computation-for-hands-systems-for-humans/">Computation for Hands, Systems for Humans</a>, taking you on the magic carpet ride that's Vi's hands &quot;craving computation&quot;, combining hardware, software, systems thinking, VR and a ton of other ideas.</p>
<p>Before you continue to Ari Rubinsztejn explains <a href="https://gereshes.com/2019/05/27/why-tracking-space-debris-is-so-hard/">Why Tracking Space Debris is so Hard</a> (thanks, nonlinear dynamics!), step under the cover of the Undercover economist Tim Harford who wrote on <a href="http://timharford.com/2019/08/the-strange-power-of-the-idea-of-average/">the strange power of the idea of average</a>, both good and bad.</p>
<p>Of course any mathematically topic is worth a deep dive into, so head into the magical depths of the Math Vault for an extensive article on <a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division/">Long Division and Its Variants (for Integers)</a> Once you're ready, jump out and get yourself back into Cantor's Paradise where Jørgen Veisdal will let you in on <a href="https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-mathematics-of-elo-ratings-b6bfc9ca1dba">the mathematics of Elo ratings</a>, a glimpse at the history of the famous ranking system.</p>
<p>Before you lose your king or queen, let Richard Elwes ask you a question befit Carol's Red Queen: <a href="https://richardelwes.co.uk/2019/09/06/how-many-sides-does-a-circle-have/">How Many Sides Does A Circle Have?</a> and be sure to follow him off on a tanget or two. If all those tangents twirled you around too much, switch to a classical, sold blog post by the amazing John Cook who will help you <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/08/27/heaps-law/">estimate vocabulary size with Heaps’ law</a> just in case you need to verify a post-humously discovered manuscript by Jane Austen.</p>
<p>To ease your way out of those particular mazes, take a sip and mingle over at <a href="https://ima.org.uk/12133/editorial-august-2019/">this month's IMA editorial</a>, if only to catch up on the Queen’s Birthday Honours List for 2019. And if you are one of those people who frequent the always dramatic birdsite, here are a two math-focused threads for you:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mathyawp/status/1162462128441139201?s=19">Also via twitter</a>, Francis Su shared his handout with <a href="https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/math131/good-math-writing.pdf">Guildelines for good mathematical writing (PDF)</a> which he says you should feel free to share with your students.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, take a carousel of math blogging perfection at Math Off The Grid where Benjamin Leis's post on <a href="https://blog.mathoffthegrid.com/2019/08/cardanos-method.html">Cardano's Method</a> starts from a new video from Mathologer (below), picks up <a href="https://twitter.com/MrHonner/status/1165417359764533248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">a tweet by Patrick Honner</a> throws in <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/aftermath/aftermath-running-a-school-for-math-lovers-with-sam-vandervelde">a podcast with Sam Vandervelde</a> and tops it off with a pointer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marden%27s_theorem">Marden's Theorem</a> to drag you into the carnival that is Wikipedia's mathematics articles.</p>
