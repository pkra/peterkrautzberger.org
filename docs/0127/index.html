<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Whats-best-TeXtoHTML-TeXtoePUB-converter-3772588.S.200461734">Somebody asked the title question on LinkedIn</a>. My reply was as follows (well, I'll do the links properly here).</p>
<h2>What's the best TeX-to-HTML or TeX-to-ePUB converter?</h2>
<p>I don't have that much experience with this, but it might be better than nothing.</p>
<p>I think the two main contenders for TeX-to-html are TeX4ht (which most LaTeX distributions ship) and <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a>.</p>
<p>TeX4ht is really a dvi-to-html converter so it behaves accordingly. In my limited experience, it is easier to get results.</p>
<p>LaTeXML seems more powerful, but I could never get it to produce results from "arbitrary" TeX (again, not a lot of time spent on this). On the other hand, LaTeXML is used systematically to convert the arXiv with reasonable success rates.</p>
<p>With respect to epub3 (ignoring html-to-epub3), I'm only aware of <a href="http://www.johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> (disclaimer: my personal favorite).</p>
<p>The current development branch has an epub3 writer with MathML support. This works reliably in a handful of tests. Pandoc does not have complete TeX support but John McFarlane is just a fantastic guy who built a strong community around pandoc -- something the two others seem to lack.</p>
<p>Addendum: <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX.SE</a> has lots of expertise on tex4ht and latexml, of course. See <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/43847/why-havent-any-tex-html-converters-been-updated-to-use-current-web-standards-s">this example</a></p>

<p>the two posts that regularly drive traffic this way are about Markdown and epub. Just saying.</p>
<h3>Bonus bonus</h3>
<p>That last sentence about John McFarlane got shortened too much and doesn't quite make sense anymore. So I finally have a reason to embed the most important comic strip on the internet.</p>

Many thanks for this…although this answer made me lock myself in the basement for a week to get tex4ht to work(lol). It is probably powerful but a very badly documented piece of software. It is even unclear if MikTeX 2.9 contains a correct installation. It would love to get high-quality images for equations (PNG and SVG) out of tex4ht just to see how far you can go without MathML and MathJax but I failed so far.<br>
Probably will try PanDoc next…

I would suggest latexml first. pandoc is not on the level you expect.</li>
