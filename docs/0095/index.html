  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-12-26">26 Dec 2011</time></span>
  <p>At the end of January, I'll be at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202353/http://scienceonline2012.com/">Scio12</a>! Science Online is that super awesomesauce (un)conference where all the hipster science bloggers hang out -- and also those fantastic little companies working on the future of doing science on <em>teh internetz (tm)</em>.</p>
<p>As a science-blog lurker, I read the blogging coverage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202083218/http://scio11.wikispaces.com/">Scio11</a>, getting not just a little jealous. It seemed to attract a great crowd and a very positive atmosphere. This year, I finally "applied", not only attending but actually representing two projects I'm involved in -- <a href="http://boolesrings.org">Booles' Rings</a> and <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org">Mathblogging.org</a>. I almost missed the opportunity because I hadn't been reading as many science blogs as I used to, instead reading more and more mathematical blogs for our <a href="http://Mathblogging.org">Mathblogging.org</a> Weekly Picks.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, only thanks to <a href="http://Mathblogging.org">Mathblogging.org</a> did <a href="http://math-frolic.blogspot.com/2011/10/math-at-science-online-2012.html">I read about</a> their shortage of math related topics in time to contact one of the godfathers of scienceblogging, <a href="http://coturnix.org/">Bora Zivkovic</a>. The wonderful Maria Droujkova from the <a href="http://mathfuture.wikispaces.com/">Math Future group</a> will be there, too, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111214180652/http://scio12.wikispaces.com/Program+draft">that's about it</a>. It's a bit of a shame; I know the name does not imply it, but I really would have liked to have seen <a href="http://www.mathoverflow.net">MathOverflow</a> represented since that's a math related net-thing way ahead of the scientists for a change. Oh well, next year.</p>
<p>Now Science Online is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> -- no talks in the traditional sense, but a focus on discussions (which, incidentally, would seem a very sensible approach to mathematics conferences really). I'm giving two tech demos, one for each project. Those will be very short (I'm designing for 5 minutes given my tendency to babble) and hopefully I'll be able to make enough sense for people to ask questions and offer their opinions.</p>
<p>Now that the year is coming to an end, I'm getting more and more excited -- I'm thinking about the demos in earnest and there are all those little things Sam and I want to fix before Scio12...</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated here and I hope I can count on your feedback if I get around to preparing something I can put up here (lots of ifs there...). Of course, I'll have my first attempt at tweeting a conference -- we'll see how that goes ;)</p>
