  <blockquote>
<p>Ok, time for part 3. We're not close to an end but I must apologize that I won't be able to post in the next week. But let's recap. In the <a href="/0075/">first part</a> I simply explained why semigroups are not partition regular and in the <a href="/0076/">second part</a> I wrote about FS-sets and, finally, introduced partial semigroups. One of the headings promised that partial semigroups will help us talk about FS-sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Are we there yet?</h2>
<p>At this point you might also ask why I talked about partial semigroups so much when I wanted to give you an easy description of FS-sets.</p>
<p>Well, it's because I did. FS-sets <strong>are</strong> partial semigroups, in fact, they are a lot like \(\mathbb{F}\)!</p>
<p>Why? Because for a sequence \((x_i: i &lt; N)\) (for some \(N\leq \omega\))</p>
<p>\[FS(x_n) := { \sum_{i \in s} x_i: s \in \mathbb{F} }.\]</p>
<p>So we have an induced partial operation on \(FS(x_n)\).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A word of warning: an FS-set can have more structure than \(\mathbb{F}\) induces -- just look at \(FS(2^n) (= \mathbb{N})\) or in a different form, look at \(FS(n)\) -- same set, but much messier when it comes to the relationship between the generating sequence and the sets of finite sums!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, we cannot assume that each element of an FS-set has a unique description via some \(s\in \mathbb{F}\) nor can we assume that the \(\mathbb{F}\)-induced operation captures all allowable sums. So, really, the whole affair is far from optimal!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if we look at the partial semigroup operation on an FS-set induced by \(\mathbb{F}\), we get a very natural partial semigroups structure with plenty of structure, even if we don't catch all aspects.</p>
<p>From this point of view, we could re-phrase Hindman's Theorem as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hindman's Theorem (bad version)</strong> Partial semigroups are partition regular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, a most horrible example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense">general nonsense</a>: hiding a concrete structure by using an abstract notion. We're not getting an arbitrary kind of partial semigroup, we're getting FS-sets, plain and simple.</p>
<p>The reason why I am writing this exposition is that, as much as I believe the preceding paragraph, I think there could something valuable in this formulation: if we could develop the notion of partial semigroup, we might just end up solving one of the big unknowns in this field. But before I can take you in that direction, we need to talk about ultrafilters.</p>
<h2>Ultrafilters on semigroups</h2>
<p>When it comes to infinite (and sometimes even finite) Ramsey-type theorems, it is often easy (or at least nice) to give a proof via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafilter">ultrafilters</a>. The reason is very simple: if we partition a set into finitely many piece, an ultrafilter contains exactly one of the pieces. This allows for a simplistic strategy: construct the right kind of ultrafilter and it will do all the work for you!</p>
<p>In case of FS-sets and Hindman's Theorem there is an even closer relation to ultrafilters, idempotent ultrafilters to be exact. I don't want to prove anything here, so whatever idempotent ultrafilters are, they are a special kind of ultrafilter on semigroups (but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis%E2%80%93Nakamura_lemma">one that exists in ZFC</a>). They come up in the most popular proof of Hindman's Theorem, the so-called Galvin-Glazer Theorem (so-called since neither of them were involved in getting the proof published and the way I'll write it it's really Galvin's).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Galvin-Glazer Theorem</strong> If \(p \in \beta \mathbb{N}\) is an idempotent ultrafilter, \(A\in p\), then \(A\) contains an FS-set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hindman's Theorem is then an immediate corollary.</p>
<p>I love the odd history of Hindman's Theorem, so allow me to digress. Around 1970 Galvin actually had the proof but didn't know if idempotent ultrafilters existed (and he had a different name because he was thinking about them the &quot;wrong&quot; way). Then in 1972 Hindman used CH and, assuming &quot;his&quot; theorem, built an ultrafilter as Galvin needed. Then in 1974 Hindman proved &quot;his&quot; theorem combinatorially. Yet in 1975 Galvin met Glazer who told him that idempotents exist (which, looked at the &quot;right&quot; way had been known since the 1958!).</p>
<p>Coming back to the relation between FS-sets and ultrafilters, there's also a reverse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If \(A\) contains an FS-set, then \(A\) is in an idempotent ultrafilter.</p>
<p>In other words, \(A\) contains an FS-set iff \(A\) is in an idempotent ultrafilter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the proof is not important right now (don't worry I'll probably get back to it later). What is important is that, in this sense, the structure of FS-sets and idempotent ultrafilters is immediately connected.</p>
<p>And the point, in fact the point of this whole series, is that this relationship is missing for stronger algebraic Ramsey Theorems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you read this far, my thanks. I won't be able to post anything next week, but there's more to follow (and written but not yet prepped for posting). So stay tuned!</p>
