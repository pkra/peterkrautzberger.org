  <h1 class="post-title">YSTN first look</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2010-05-08">08 May 2010</time></span>
  <p>The last week was rather busy and I did not find time to blog. The good news is that I will be attending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100612014546/http://euclid.colorado.edu/~kasterma/blast/">BLAST 2010 [Wayback Machine]</a> in Boulder come June and they are very kind to support me.</p>
<p>After having been very excited last week with the start of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">Young Set Theory Network [Wayback Machine]</a> I wanted write a follow up on the project that hopefully helps people who want to become active in it. The text was supposed to help me identify how I would want to contribute. But it became a bit more so I decided to post it.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Well, that’s easy enough. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> uses a wiki, more specifically wikimedia’s MediaWiki used by <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> itself. That is one reliable and flexible piece of software. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> does not allow for editing without registration since it is too small a project to battle spam. But I hope they will change that in the future — after all, MediaWiki does allow for other measures such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">captcha</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment I would say the biggest drawback is that registration does not allow for free editing. For this you have to wait until a user with “Set Theorist” status upgrades you to that status. This probably hinders the development of the network in the beginning. But I don’t think it will stay that way, rather it will speed up the development once critical mass is reached. So if you want to be upgraded to Set Theorist status just contact me via the comments.</p>
<p>I think in the long run it might turn out that the project needs a more dynamic technology such as specialised social networks via e.g. <a href="http://www.mixxt.net/">mixxt</a>. But even in that case an open and established platform such as MediaWiki is a good start. Now if only MathML was used instead of these ugly PNGs…</p>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN's [Wayback Machine]</a> concept is explained at its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110709063115/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Young_Set_Theory_Network:Community_Portal">Community Portal [Wayback Machine]</a>. In my humble opinion the concept is too complex, it is trying too much at once. Reading it for the first time left me with the impression that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> wants to be a simultaneous (albeit set-theoretically specialised) copy of a ton of other projects that have been around for a while. Following <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/">Jeff Jarvis’s Rule</a> I don’t think this is a good idea.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong everything on that list would be really good to have. But most points are already covered — and extremely well at that! So I think it might be a better idea for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN’s [Wayback Machine]</a> development to follow Jarvis: do what you can do best and link to the rest. In other words, add and aggregate to other projects and only do what is not already done better elsewhere. This is also important so as not to isolate the content from a more general (mathematical) audience.</p>
<p>Let me comment on the list from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110709063115/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Young_Set_Theory_Network:Community_Portal">Community Portal [Wayback Machine]</a> to show you what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Notes etc.</em> Talks are usually stored by authors or conference websites, it is the right place logically (and legally). Everything else should be on the author’s homepage or the <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>. Everything book-like should be linked on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120512220416/http://mathonline.andreaferretti.it/pages/home">MathOnline [Wayback Machine]</a> (which has an empty set theory section last time I checked).</li>
<li><em>Theses</em> should be on the Author’s site or the <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a></li>
<li><em>Unpublishable original research</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Paper annotations</em> That’s a cool idea, especially when annotations are joined work</li>
<li><em>proofs of known results</em> again: Author’s site or <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a></li>
<li><em>observations</em> Blogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>General articles</em> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.tricki.org/">Tricki</a></li>
<li><em>Young Set Theory activities</em> the list of conferences is a good feature</li>
<li><em>Possibilities for discussion pages</em> social networks, blogs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave">Google wave</a> are better suited for discussions than a wiki.
<ul>
<li><em>Open questions</em> <a href="http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/">Open Problem Garden</a></li>
<li><em>Research discussions</em> <a href="http://mathoverflow.net">mathoverflow</a> , <a href="http://polymathprojects.org/">polymath</a>, social networks, blogs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave">waves</a></li>
<li><em>Working groups</em> social network, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wave">waves</a> , blogs, <a href="http://polymathprojects.org/">polymath</a></li>
<li><em>Technology group</em> Good idea, will repost my Winterschool post there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Job application documents</em> That would be one cool feature</li>
<li>Other set-theory related writing
<ul>
<li><em>Book reviews</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120512220416/http://mathonline.andreaferretti.it/pages/home">MathOnline [Wayback Machine]</a></li>
<li><em>Essays</em> Blogs, <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This may seem very negative, but I believe it can prove to be a strength. With a better focus on areas that are not covered anywhere and a high level of transparency and connectivity towards other projects it will be much easier for the network to create momentum.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Ok, so this is a bit of problem and the reason why I think the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> needs focus. There is no content as far as I can see. The wiki claims to have four articles, three of them help pages (which is quite ok, help pages are extremely important). So the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> needs to gather a few people that will actively contribute. Content that either gives people something to read or something to do. If this is not possible a later relaunch could be an option.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The main conclusion is that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> uses solid technology and has many ideas on what it wants to become. So I think I will invest time into contributing. However, it is not without alternatives so for most people it will have to prove that it can be a good addition to the status quo — wikipedia, tricki, mathoverflow, arXiv, email, social networks, blogs, twitter cannot be ignored but easily embraced. In particular, I think there is need to give those visitors that want to help more concrete tasks, tell them how they can contribute, be it small or large.</p>
<p>Above all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110711064402/http://young-set-theory.net/wiki/Main_Page">YSTN [Wayback Machine]</a> needs a small group of engaged people with focus to start breathing life into it. It need not be perfect, it just needs to grow.</p>
