  <p>[week 4 of the challenge. It's time for a quick post to catch up after last week's delay.]</p>
<p>As you know, this blogging challenge of mine is based on the observation that I would like to write more. And then Jeff Atwood reminds me in <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/">this interesting piece</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we badly need to incentivize listening</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which makes me wonder if my natural tendency to let things brew for ages might not be a good thing. This blogging challenge will invariably show if I'm actually able to write in decent quality under tighter constraints. (Right now, I'm not so sure.) So perhaps I will have to realize that silence is golden.</p>
<p>On a related note, in recent months, I was forced to think about my comment &quot;policy&quot;. This hadn't really come up before since I get very few comments and even fewer from strangers. But I think I should point out that nobody leaving a comment should expect said comment to be posted. Similary, nobody should expect a comment that has been posted to stay up (especially if gets posted automatically after I've allowed a comment in the past). Finally, nobody should expect me to reply to a comment even if I've replied to other comments and even if that happened in the same thread.</p>
<p>This policy has very little to do with trolling, actually, but more with off-topic comments and comments on ancient posts documenting how things have changed (I'm so surprised! not). It's also related to a different point: I'm probably switching off automated comments at some point next year (ooooooh, something will change, hint hint).</p>
<p>The number of worthwhile comments I get is roughly 1 per month (vs 5-10K of spam). So instead of a comment sytem, I'll figure out some way you can quickly send me a comment and then I will add it manually. This move is not just laziness about dealing with spam (it will be slightly more work, I suspect) but also reflects the fact that I consider your comments to be additions to the content, not separate from it. This does not mean that a comment needs to be serious, of course -- silly comments are just as (more?) (more!) relevant to me, so I hope people will keep'em coming.</p>

Silly comments are my specialty. As are most form of off topic. I think that I would have managed to squeeze the 45 minutes I have to teach into an actual 45 minutes time frame if I would lay off the off topic comments and jokes to my classroom.<br>
However, I do feel that humor is an integral part of my teaching, so I won’t do that, and I’ll keep the usual five minutes overtime.<br>
Hey, look at that, I’m the first half of a soccer game! :)
