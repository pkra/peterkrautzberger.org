  <p>You may have seen <a href="https://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0186/">my previous post</a> on why MathML is a failed web standard and, how, for better or worse, I think the focus needs to be on helping the tools that work on the web today.</p>
<p>The obvious problem is: how should that work? How do we get this small, disparate, and sometimes divided community of math tools for the web to inform web standards and, ultimately, browser development?</p>
<p>Well, it's time to find out.</p>
<p>A couple of people have been working towards a new effort and we've now formed a W3C Community Group. The name may sound funny but it's what this group is after: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/mathonwebpages">Getting Math onto Web Pages</a>. No fuss, no drama, no limitations. The focus is on how we do this today and how we can make it easier.</p>
<p>So now it's up to us.</p>
<p>If you're a developer of a tool that makes math work on the web today and want to help shape the future, then it's time to step up. I know your resources are probably tight, in fact most projects out there are run by idealists, as side-projects or chronically under-funded. I hear you.</p>
<p>But you built a tool because nothing was getting the job done. Standards? Same thing. We need to <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/welcome-to-specifiction/6">learn about the process</a>, understand what we want to do and what we can do, and ultimately, help build standards that work for everyone. Otherwise, the job won't get done.</p>
<p>So <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/mathonwebpages">join the Community Group</a></strong> and work together to <a href="http://movethewebforward.org/">move the web forward</a> for mathematics and beyond.</p>
<p>Need more information? Here's the initial description from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/mathonwebpages">CG homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many technical issues in presenting mathematics in today's<br>
Open Web Platform, which has lead to the poor access to Mathematics in<br>
Web Pages. This is in spite of the existing de jure or de facto<br>
standards for authoring mathematics, like MathML, LaTeX, or asciimath,<br>
which have been around for a very long time and are widely used by the<br>
mathematical and technical communities.</p>
<p>While MathML was supposed to solve the problem of rendering mathematics<br>
on the web it lacks in both implementations and general interest from<br>
browser vendors.</p>
<p>However, in the past decade, many math rendering tools have been pushing<br>
math on the web forward using HTML/CSS and SVG.</p>
<p>One of the identified issues is that, while browser manufacturers have<br>
continually improved and extended their HTML and CSS layout engines, the<br>
approaches to render mathematics have not been able to align with these<br>
improvements. In fact, the current approaches to math layout could be<br>
considered  to be largely disjoint from the other technologies of OWP.</p>
<p>Another key issue, is that exposing (and thus leveraging) semantic<br>
information of mathematical and scientific content on the web needs to<br>
move towards modern practices and standards instead of being limited to<br>
a single solution (MathML). Such information is critical for<br>
accessibility, machine-readability, and re-use of mathematical content.</p>
<p>This Community Group intends to look at the problems of math on the web<br>
in a very bottom-up manner.</p>
<p>Experts in this group should identify how the core OWP layout engines,<br>
centered around HTML, SVG, and CSS, can be re-used for the purpose of<br>
mathematical layout by mapping mathematical entities on top of these,<br>
thereby ensuring a much more efficient result, and making use of current<br>
and future OWP optimization possibilities.  Similarly, experts should<br>
work to identify best practices for semantics from the point of view of<br>
today's successful solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work should also reveal where the shortcomings are, from the<br>
mathematical layout point of view, in the details of these OWP<br>
technologies, and propose improvements and possible additions to these,<br>
with the ultimate goal of reaching out to the responsible W3C Working<br>
Groups to make these changes. This work may also reveal new technology<br>
areas that should be specified and standardized on their own right, for<br>
example in the area of Web Accessibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate goal is to pave the way for a standard, highly optimized<br>
implementation architecture, on top of which mathematical syntaxes, like<br>
LaTeX or MathML, may be mapped to provide an efficient display of<br>
mathematical formulae.</p>
<p>Note that, although this community group will concentrate on<br>
mathematics, many other areas, e.g., science and engineering, will<br>
benefit from (and factor into) the approach and from the core<br>
architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PS: We've also applied for a CG slot at <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/09/TPAC/">TPAC 2016</a> in Lisbon for a face-to-face of the CG as well as the opportunity to talk to other groups. Fingers crossed!</p>
