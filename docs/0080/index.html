<p>I know, I know, it's part 6 already. <a href="/0079/">Last time</a> I finally formulated the Central Sets Theorem. This part will just be a small bridge. But at least you'll finally know why on earth I am writing this, i.e., what big open question I'm actually trying to build some intuitions for.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Central Sets and ultrafilters</h2>
<p>Before we can move on in this series I should tell you a little bit about the relationship between ultrafilters and central sets -- and finally give you something close to a definition.</p>
<p>If you <a href="/0077/">already believed me</a> that idempotent ultrafilters exist, you might also believe me that there's a special kind of idempotent ultrafilters, they are called <strong>minimal idempotents</strong>. The reason for the name &quot;minimal&quot; is a partial order on idempotents coming from ring theory. Yet again, we'll skip the definition -- I would first have to convince you that \(\beta \mathbb{N}\) is actually a semigroup and, again, I don't want to go there right now.</p>
<p>In any case, there are those idempotent ultrafilters which are minimal idempotents. As <a href="/0078/">I mentioned before</a>, Hillel Furstenberg had introduced the notion of central set via recurrence in dynamical systems. It took a couple of years until <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9947-1990-0982232-5">in 1990 Vitaly Bergelson and Neil Hindman</a> helped establish that centrality can be framed extremely well in terms of ultrafilters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (Bergelson, Hindman)</strong> \(A\subseteq \mathbb{N}\) is <em>central</em> iff \(A\) is in a minimal idempotent ultrafilter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was, I think, quite a crazy and beautiful result at the time and its simplicity is still stunning (although, arguably, you won't agree since I didn't give you the complicated definition in terms of dynamics).</p>
<p>This leaves us with the following situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>central sets and minimal idempotents correspond neatly and</li>
<li>we have a Ramsey-type theorem (the Central Sets Theorem) that central sets fulfil</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not as optimal as it could be! If you remember, we were even better off with Hindman's Theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set is contained in an idempotent ultrafilter if and only if it &quot;satisfies&quot; Hindman's Theorem (i.e., includes an FS-set).</p>
<p><strong>In fact</strong>, a set is an FS-set if and only if it is contained in an idempotent ultrafilter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hindman's Theorem and idempotent ultrafilters corresponded directly. The unfortunate situation for central sets is that (as far as I know) no version of the Central Sets Theorem is able to accomplish a correspondence of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wanted</strong> &quot;A set is included in a minimal idempotent ultrafilter (i.e., is a central set) if and only if it fulfills the following Central Sets Theorem&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be the dream, I think. And this is, in a manner of speaking, the whole point of this series. How can we get to this? As you may have guessed, I believe partial semigroups can help shed light on this. So I will return to them in the continuation.</p>
