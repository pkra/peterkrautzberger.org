  <h1 class="post-title">Just when I thought I was out</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2014-05-31">31 May 2014</time></span>
  <p>I recently pondered whether I should stop reading the few remaining <a href="http://mathoverflow.net">mathoverflow</a> and <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com">math.stackexchange</a> feeds I keep in my feed reader (remember that archaic technology? I still use it heavily). Ever since I left research, I had dialed down the number of tags I was following on those wonderful sites, both because it was painful and because I lost interest (as contradictory as that may sound); in the end, all I kept were the [ultrafilter] tag on MO and the [set theory] tag on <a href="http://math.SE">math.SE</a>.</p>
<p>But I found myself brushing past even those few postings, so that yesterday I thought it was time to move on and remove them from my feed reader, de fact closing the &quot;math&quot; section of my feed reader, where all my research related feeds ended up. And then just as I am about to, I see <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/a/814110">this question and answer</a> which, while neither spectacular or particular, reminded me why I once fell in love with set theory.</p>
<p>So, Asaf, I will call you Joey Zasa from now on.</p>

You’re welcome! :-)</li>

Nice question and answers there! Set theory is fun Peter, it doesn’t have to be your job for you to play with it :)

<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2014/01/06<br>
Thanks, Ioanna. Well, when I left set theory, part of the reason was that it had stopped being fun. But I always thought our generation is lucky in the way the web helps us stay connected with our research area long after we left for other ventures (I even left a productive comment on a <a href="http://math.SE">math.SE</a> answer this year 😉 ).</li>

Bam! Math! \[ f: X \to Y \] And $ \sqrt{2} \le 2 $
<ul>
<li><strong>Asaf Karagila</strong>, 2014/06/06<br>
The first one is false in general, and the second one is false in \(\mathbb Q\) and \(\mathbb C\).<br>
😉

Indeed. It was just a test for MathJax rendering in the comments. I should be less careless 😉
<ul>
<li><strong>Asaf Karagila</strong><br>
Have you been dabbling with intuitionistic logic again?<br>
“Less careless” + Law of excluded middle = “More careful”.<br>
But he use of LEM is essential here! :-)</li>
