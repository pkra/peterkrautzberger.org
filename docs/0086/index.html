  <h1 class="post-title">Grigorieff forcing collapsing the continuum</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-10-16">16 Oct 2011</time></span>
  <p>This is a short technical post, more a note-to-self so that I know where to look this up if I ever need it again. It is also somewhat of a correction of something I said during my talk in Toronto in June.</p>
<h3>Grigorieff forcing</h3>
<p>If you don't remember, here's the quick and dirty (i.e. traditional) way to define Grigorieff (or Gregorieff depending on your choice of latinization) forcing: it consists of partial functions on \(\omega\) which are defined on a &quot;small&quot; set, i.e., a set in the dual ideal of a filter. For simplicity, let's focus on ultrafilters. asd s</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Grigorieff Forcing</strong> Given a ultrafilter \(U\) on \(\omega\), let \[\mathbb{P}_U = \{ f: A \rightarrow \omega : \omega \setminus A \in U \}.\]<br>
Partially order such functions by \(f\leq g\) iff \(f \supseteq g\), i.e., \(f\) has more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can think of Grigorieff conditions as perfect binary trees with complete branching on an ultrafilter set and &quot;parallel movement&quot; elsewhere. But I said quick and dirty is enough here, so let's not worry too much.</p>
<p>Grigorieff forcing is famous for being the forcing that Shelah used for the first model without P-points. One of the reasons this is possible is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (Shelah)</strong> If \(U\) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafilter#Ultrafilters_on_.CF.89">P-point</a>, then \(\mathbb{P}_U\) is proper and \(\omega^\omega\)-bounding. In particular, \(\mathbb{P}_U\) does not collapse \(\omega_1\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last week, David Chodounsky let me know that Bohuslav Balcar showed him the following &quot;folklore&quot; result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Optimality</strong> If \(U\) is not a P-point, then \(\mathbb{P}_U\) collapses the continuum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This result is mentioned in Jech's Multiple Forcing book, but without proof and I have never seen one published. (Which, to tell the truth, is the reason I thought it was wrong but more about that later).</p>
<h4>a proof</h4>
<ul>
<li>If \(U\) is not a P-point, then there exists a partition \(\bigcup_{n \in \omega} I_n\) such that every \(A\in U\) intersects infinitely many \(I_n\) in an infinite set.</li>
<li>In particular, no \(I_n \in U\) and, without loss, all \(I_n\) are infinite.</li>
<li>In the ground model \(V\), let's enumerate each \(P(I_n)\) as \((A^\alpha_n)_{\alpha &lt; \mathfrak{c}}\) (bijectively).</li>
<li><strong>First observation</strong> The generic \(\dot G \subseteq \omega\) has \[\Vdash I_n \cap \dot G \in V\] for every \(n\).
<ul>
<li>Fix \(n\).</li>
<li>Since \(I_n\notin U\), we can decide any condition \(f\) arbitrarily on \(I_n\).</li>
<li>In other words, there's a dense set of conditions \(g\) with \(dom(g) \supseteq I_n\).</li>
<li>But any condition in this dense set forces what we want, i.e., \(g \Vdash \dot G \cap I_n = g^{-1}(1) \cap I_n\) -- which is a set in the ground model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So let \(G\) be a generic over \(V\).</li>
<li><strong>Second observation</strong> In \(V[G]\), we can define a map \(H: \omega \rightarrow (2^\omega)^V\), mapping \(n\) to \(\alpha\) with \(A^n_\alpha = G \cap I_n\).
<ul>
<li>Check that this is possible because this intersection is a ground model set, hence appears in the enumerations we fixed earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Third Observation</strong> \(H\) is cofinal.
<ul>
<li>Given any \(\alpha\), we want to find \(n\) such that \(H(n) > \alpha\).</li>
<li>For a density argument, fix any condition \(f\).</li>
<li>Since \(dom(f)\) is a small set, we can find \(n\) such that \[\left\vert I_n \cap \omega \setminus dom(f) \right\vert  = \omega.\]</li>
<li>Therefore, we can find \(A \subseteq I_n \cap \omega \setminus dom(f)\) such that \(A \cup f^{-1}(1) = A^n_\beta\) for some \(\beta > \alpha\).</li>
<li>Extend \(f\) to all of \(I_n\) such that \(f^{-1}(1) = A\).</li>
<li>Then \(f \Vdash \dot G \cap I_n = A^n_\beta\) -- as desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>An honest mistake</h3>
<p>David and I thought we had a proof that Grigorieff forcing with a stable ordered union ultrafilter is proper and \(\omega^\omega\)-bounding. This is, of course, impossible -- and with this knowledge we could find the mistake in our proof. We still think that &quot;morally&quot; speaking there should be an analogue forcing for the union filter world. But that's a different story.</p>

That's a neat argument! I always find situations like this where you only show that \(cf(\mathfrak{c}^V) = \omega\) a little strange. Is there any hope to get a nice surjection from \(\omega\) onto \(\mathfrak{c}^V\)?<br>
(There is a small typo where you have \(2^\mathfrak{c}\) instead of \(2^\omega\) or \(\mathfrak{c}\).)

Well, Andreas thought of one when I talked to him about this but writing this post I felt it didn't work (I'll ask again).<br>
He wanted to enumerate \(P(I_n) / fin\) instead of \(P(I_n)\) but I didn't see how this helps, i.e., I don't see how \(f\) can be extended to be equal mod fin to \(A^n_\alpha\).<br>
(Thanks, I'll fix the typo.)</li>
<li><strong>François</strong>, 2011/10/17<br>
Right, that trick would work if you knew that \(\operatorname{dom}(f) \cap I_n\) is finite for some \(n\), but I don't see why that would be the case...
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2011/10/20<br>
Ah! I forgot to update this -- Francois, Andreas fixed it. It's not hard, really: instead of a regular enumeration just pick a map so that the power set of every infinite subset of \(\omega\) has full range. Proceed as in the proof and after finding \(n\), choose the subset with number \(\alpha\).
<ul>
<li><strong>François</strong>, 2011/10/21<br>
Full range?
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2011/10/29<br>
Surjective range. Inductively build a map \(P(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow \mathfrak{c}\) in such a way that for every infinite \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\), we get that the restriction of our map to \(P(A)\) is still surjective.<br>
Then we can use the above argument: as before we find an \(I_n\) where our condition has left out an infinite set. Now pick from the power set of that infinite set a suitable candidate for \(\alpha\) -- done.<br>
Does that make more sense?</li>
