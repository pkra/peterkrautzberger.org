  <h1 class="post-title">Saturday morning math blogs</h1>
  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-01-15">15 Jan 2011</time></span>
  <p>Well, with <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org">mathblogging.org</a> up and running in beta I have been reading far too many math blogs (and I love it). This morning there was a lot of interesting stuff out there and I thought it might be interesting to mention some, especially those that I actually left a comment on. After all, that’s what makes blogging come alive and I don’t comment often enough.</p>
<h2>researchblogging vs arxivblogging</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2011/01/regression_disc.html" title="...">Andrew Gelman (sorry for the error earlier) of Statistical Modelling</a> posted what is essentially a short review of a paper. I was too lazy to check if the paper had been published, but I left a comment anyway (although now, a couple of hours later I can’t see it and I can’t remember if comments are creened or if I screwed up; oh well, I’ll risk a double post tomorrow). The post reminded me of one the things I miss in the mathematical blogosphere — using <a href="http://researchblogging.org">researchblogging.org</a> to spread word about reviews. I mean, go there and check the mathematics tag. It could really use more posts to give the almighty mathscinet neutrality machine some competition… (and yes, that includes myself and I already have an idea).</p>
<p>The question is if arXiv papers are “allowed” there since researchblogging is all about peer-reviewed papers. Of course, <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/51056/is-there-a-place-where-people-discuss-arxiv-org-papers">there was a discussion on mathoverflow</a> on discussing arxiv papers and there actually seems to be <a href="http://scirate.com/">a project for that called scirate</a> unfortunately with little traffic, the last development blog entry from 2008 and little moderation. Oh well.</p>
<h2>Pondering visitors</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-reddit-aftereffect">Lieven Le Bruyn of neverendingbooks</a> discusses his recent prominence on reddit/math which led him to review how his readers find him. It’s an interesting read and made me write a short post for myself answering his fundamental questions at the end for mysel (which I’ll post some other time).</p>
<h2>Writing experiments</h2>
<p><a href="http://aperiodical.com/2011/01/400-words-in-30-minutes-on-chaos-and-the-weather/">Peter Rowlett of Travels in mathematics</a> starts an experiment for writing more frequently. Great idea, he does a great job and makes me want to copy him. (but, boy, I had forgotten how complicated blogspot’s comment system is…)</p>
