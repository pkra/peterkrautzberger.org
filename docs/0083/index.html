  <span class="post-date"><time datetime="2011-09-29">29 Sep 2011</time></span>
  <p>There are a couple of reasons to write a quick follow-up post to the <a href="/0082/" title="Flat Ultrafilters (Michigan Logic Seminar Sept 21, 2011)">notes for my talk on flat ultrafilters</a>.</p>
<h3>Small addenda included</h3>
<p>I updated <a href="/0082/">the notes</a> a little. Nothing much, some bad pictures and some comments.</p>
<h3>Video recording is online</h3>
<p>I uploaded my talk to vimeo -- find it embedded below or <a href="http://vimeo.com/29738390">look it up on vimeo</a>.</p>

<h3>Flat ultrafilters and the Katetov order</h3>
<p>There's one thing worth stressing though. Remember <a href="/0082/" title="Flat Ultrafilters (Michigan Logic Seminar Sept 21, 2011)">when I wrote</a> that it's a little cheating to say that a flat ultrafilter is simply an ultrafilter on \([\omega]^{&lt;\omega}\) that extends a certain filter?</p>
<p>Instead of cheating, I should have talked about the <strong>Katetov order</strong>. Usually, the Katetov order is defined for ideals, but let me give the formulation for filters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> If \(F,G\) are filters on \(X\). Then \(F\leq_K G\) if there exists a map \(f:X \to X\) such that (the filter generated by) \(f[G] \supseteq F\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For ultrafilters, this is of course the same as the Rudin-Keisler order. But for filters it is more general. If you confuse it with near coherence of filters, remember that near coherence asks only for coherence (the union generates a filter), not inclusion of the image (also, near coherence allows only finite-to-one functions).</p>
<p>In any case, we can now formulate flatness very easily. The key is the important filter that Farah, Philips and Steprans had identified in their construction for flat ultrafilters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The flatness filter</strong> Let's define the flatness filter \(F\) on \([\omega]^{&lt;\omega}\) to be the filter generated by<br>
\[X_n := \{ s\in [\omega]^{&lt;\omega}: |s|\geq n\ \}\]<br>
for all \(n \in \omega\) as well as<br>
\[X_f := \{s \in [\omega]^{&lt;\omega}: (\forall i &lt; |s|) f(s_i) &lt; s_{i+1} \}\]<br>
for \(f\in \omega^\omega\) increasing with \(f(0)>0\) -- where \((s_i)_{i \in |s|}\) is the natural enumeration of \(s\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it's easy to formulate flatness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Flat ultrafilter</strong> An ultrafilter \(p\) (on some countable set) is flat if \(p\geq_K F\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this true? The work with the original definition (simplifying the flatness scale) gave us something along the lines of &quot;\(p\) is isomorphic to an ultrafilter that extends \(F\)&quot; -- but together with the observation that Rudin-Keisler successors of flat ultrafilters are flat, we get the above.</p>
<p>Now this reformulation is not just the result of trying to understand (and simplify) the original definition. It also makes a few observations absolutely immediate. Let me jot down a few without proof</p>
<ul>
<li>Since \(F \geq_K Fr \otimes Fr\) (where \(Fr\) is the Fréchet filter on \(\omega\)), no flat ultrafilter can be a P-point.</li>
<li>Similarly, \(F\geq \otimes_n Fr\) and so this must hold for every flat ultrafilter.</li>
<li>In particular, this tells that there are infinitely many skies in the ultrapower of \(\omega\) of a flat ultrafilter.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so forth. But that's for another post if I get around to it.</p>
