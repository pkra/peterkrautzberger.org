  <blockquote>
<p>Well, I hope you didn't miss me while I was on my first summer vacation in three years. So let's continue this series. If you remember, <a href="/0077/">part 3</a> consisted mainly of the observation that FS-sets have a partial semigroup structure induced by \(\mathbb{F}\) as well as me telling you that there's a immediate correspondence between FS-sets and idempotent ultrafilters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm slowly getting where I wanted to head all along with this series. When I write &quot;my most lacking intuitions&quot; in the title, I have my intuitions about central sets in mind. They are most lacking, I assure you. But with this series I wanted to clear my head a little. So let's head down the rabbit hole, no questions asked.</p>
<h2>Towards the Central Sets Theorem</h2>
<p>The Central Sets Theorem was conceived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_F%C3%BCrstenberg">Hillel Fürstenberg</a>. I know relatively little about its history so I am still amazed by the fact that anyone could come up with it -- it's such a strange creature. Fürstenberg proved it for \(\mathbb{Z}\) (but I'll keep considering \(\mathbb{N}\), the two situations are equivalent anyway). The notion of centrality has its origins in ergodic theory -- unsurprisingly for Furstenberg. As fascinating and fruitful as the connection between ergodic Ramsey theory and Algebra in the Stone–Čech compactification is, I don't plan to introduce the technology in this series, because it will take us too far from the path I have in mind (mind you, I haven't even introduced the semigroup structure on \(\beta \mathbb{N}\), so really, I shouldn't introduce the ergodic point of view of which I know far less).</p>
<p>Fürstenberg devised the notion of <strong>central set</strong> (for subsets of \(\mathbb{N}\)) which was determined by recurrence phenomena in dynamical systems. Again, I don't want to discuss the dynamical point of view but I'll give the ultrafilter characterization later. The key for a connection to Ramsey theory was simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theorem (Fürstenberg)</strong> Central sets (whatever they are) are partition regular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever central sets are (sorry for being temporarily mysterious), it is shocking how much algebraic structure central sets have to offer -- which is what the Central Sets Theorem is all about. It took a while and until Neil Hindman and Vitaly Bergelson made the connection between the algebraic/ultrafilter side and the ergodic side apparent. Nevertheless, the precise level of the algebraic closure of central sets is still a mystery. And this mystery is the reason for this series.</p>
<h2>A detour: FP-sets and their condensations</h2>
<p>One thing we should do before formulating the theorem is the following. What does an FS-set mean in the context of \(\mathbb{F}\)? Generally speaking, in a (partial) semigroup we have FP-sets (&quot;finite products&quot; instead of &quot;finite sums&quot;): given a sequence \((x_n: n\in \omega)\) we write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\[ FP(x_n) = { \prod_{i \in s} x_i: s \in \mathbb{F} }. \]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, in the partial semigroup scenario, we should also think of this as a statement restricted to defined products. However, usually (e.g., in Hindman's Theorem) all products will be defined. Also, in the non-commutative case (which I wholeheartedly ignore in this series), this notation is supposed to be read &quot;in order&quot;, i.e., the products are in the natural order of \(s \subseteq \omega\).</p>
<p>For a crucial example, consider \(\mathbb{F}\) itself.</p>
<p>If we have a sequence \((s_n : n\in \omega)\) in \(\mathbb{F}\) such that the \(s_n\) are pairwise disjoint, then the FP-set will be just fine -- all products are defined in our partial semigroup.</p>
<p>This is a critical example also because we can transfer such partial subsemigroups easily: If \(FP(s_n) \subseteq \mathbb{F}\) and we have some \(FS(x_n) \subseteq \mathbb{N}\), then we can consider \(y_n := \sum_{i\in s_n} x_i\). As long as the \(s_n\) are pairwise disjoint, we get</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\[ FS(y_n) \subseteq FS(x_n).\]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have a partial subsemigroup of \(FS(x_n)\) induced by a partial subsemigroup of \(\mathbb{F}\)!</p>
<p>And this is actually a typical phenomenon thanks to Hindman's Theorem. Remember,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hindman's Theorem</strong> If we partition an FS-set into finitely many pieces, one piece will contain an FS-set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Condensations and Intuitions</h3>
<p>There's one important question when it comes to developing an intuition: what should we expect when we partition again and again? One typical phenomenon is the following: if we take some \(FS(x_n)\) and partition into two pieces where one piece contains exactly the elements of the generating sequence \({ x_n : n \in \omega }\). By Hindman's Theorem, one part of the partition will contain an FS-set -- but that's not going to be \({ x_n : n \in \omega }\)! Consider the case \(x_n = 2^n\), then \({ 2^n : n \in \omega }\) certainly does not contain an FS-set, it does not even satisfy Schur's Theorem!</p>
<p>So what happens in this case? Well, we can easily describe many FS-sets in the other part of the partition; e.g., take every other generator and add: \(y_n= x_{2n} +x_{2n+1}\). Then \(FS(y_n)\) is good for the second part of the partition.</p>
<p>More generally, we could take any pairwise disjoint \((s_n : n\in \omega)\) in \(\mathbb{F}\), just make sure that no \(s_n\) is a singleton. Then as above, \(FP(s_n)\) induces an FS-subset of \(FS(x_n)\) -- which will lie completely in the &quot;large&quot; part of the partition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A word of caution: in a certain sense, partitions as the one above are unusually simple because one part does not contain an FS-set. In general, you should expect all parts to contain FS-sets (for example, when separating different idempotent ultrafilters). Nevertheless, I would say that a huge chunk of arguments regarding <a href="/0026/">strongly summable ultrafilters</a> relies on such &quot;simple&quot; partitions -- so they are extremely useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point I'm trying to make is that whenever we repeatedly partition an FS-set, Hindman's Theorem will give us homogeneous FS-sets -- but you should expect the elements in the generating sequence to be sums of <em>many</em> elements of the original generators!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why a sequence \((y_n: n \in \omega)\) in some \(FS(x_n)\) with \(FS(y_n)\subseteq FS(x_n)\) is called a <strong>condensation</strong> of \((x_n :n \in \omega)\) -- because generally speaking <em>many</em> elements from \(x_n\) are condensed into one of the \(y_n\) (of course, some \(x_n\) might just be dropped completely). The term &quot;condensation&quot; is also used in arbitrary (partial) semigroups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh and to be absolutely clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sequences in \(\mathbb{F}\) are <strong>always assumed to be pairwise disjoint</strong> (so that they are pairwise compatible in our partial operation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, that's enough for this part, I think. Next time, I'll finally talk about the Central Sets Theorem.</p>
