One thing about my that creepe me out, again. As part of pushing out the post at O'Reilly, I claimed the article on my g+ profile. "Why?", you may ask. Because it helps the Google rank of the article and any other articles I have associated with my account. I hadn't reflected much on this "feature" before. On the one hand, it's a very interesting and powerful way of getting people to use google+ -- it will help improve your "personal" page rank, increase the impact of what you create, anywhere on the web. On the other hand.
