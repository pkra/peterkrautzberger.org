The currently most recent post at the IMU's blog (which finally has proper RSS-feeds) is a piece by [Peter Olver](http://www.math.umn.edu/~olver/) entitled [_Beyond Journals_](http://blog.mathunion.org/journals/?no_cache=1&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5BshowUid%5D=24&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Byear%5D=2011&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bmonth%5D=12&tx_t3blog_pi1%5BblogList%5D%5Bday%5D=14&cHash=4cc259744b2132a1a30cbb0cf1188028). I had the pleasure of meeting Peter as well as [Carol Hutchins](http://www.nyu.edu/pages/facgov/reps.html) for a cup of coffee in Boston during the Join Math Meetings this month. Both Peter and Carol are on the IMU's [CEIC committee](http://math.umn.edu/~olver/ceic.html), something I had to admit I'd never heard of before meeting them.

Anyway, Peter's piece is at heart a summary of the ideas [he had proposed](http://www.ams.org/notices/201108/rtx110801124p.pdf) last September in the Notices of the AMS. It's an interesting piece, so I invite you to read it in short and long. Don't worry, this post will still be here when you return.

How nice, you're back!

The reason I'm writing about this is not just to plug that I met these active members of our scientific community. Rather, the title "Beyond Journals" triggered something, it helped me focus a thought that had been swirling around my mind for a while now without ever taking a concrete shape. And from the title, you can guess what it is.

## Journals work -- for papers

Much of the publishing debate
